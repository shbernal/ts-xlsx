// What a module imports, and everything a module reaches, for the four gates that ask.
//
// `check-layering`, `check-browser-safe`, `size-budget` and `smoke-dist` each walk the module graph,
// and each had grown its own copy of the walk: four file listers, four specifier regexes, two
// byte-identical path-segment collapse loops and two byte-identical closure functions.
//
// The four regexes did not agree, and the disagreement was live rather than theoretical.
// `size-budget` matched either quote style and recorded *why* in a comment: the emitter's quoting
// flipped between TypeScript 6 and 7. `check-layering` and `check-browser-safe` matched single quotes
// only, so the same flip in the *source* formatter would have made both gates see zero imports and
// report a clean graph. A gate that silently stops checking is worse than no gate, and these two are
// named in CLAUDE.md as part of what makes the machine-checkable net the primary guarantor of
// correctness. Four answers to "what does this module import" is four definitions of the graph that
// net is guaranteeing.
//
// None of the four stripped comments before matching either, so a commented-out import read as a real
// one: a false layering violation, from prose.
//
// Paths here are always `/`-separated, whatever the platform, because a graph keyed by path needs one
// spelling per file: half these callers build repo-relative strings by hand and half use `node:path`,
// and on Windows the two disagree on the separator, which would count one module twice.
