// `lefthook install`, but only where lefthook would own the hooks it writes.
//
// `prepare` runs this on every `pnpm install` — and, since pnpm 11 verifies dependencies before
// running any script, that is effectively *every* `pnpm run` and `pnpm exec` too. So whatever
// `prepare` does, it does constantly, and a non-zero exit from it takes the whole package manager
// down with it: `pnpm run lint` never reaches Biome, it dies in the install that pnpm ran first.
//
// Calling `lefthook install` directly is exactly that hazard. Lefthook refuses to install while
// `core.hooksPath` points somewhere it does not own, and exits 1 — correctly, because writing its
// wrappers into a hooks directory shared by every repo on the machine would clobber whatever else
// lives there. But "correctly refuses" and "fails the build" are different things, and only the
// first one is wanted here. A developer with a machine-wide hooks path could not run a single
// script in this repo.
//
// Lefthook's own two suggestions are both worse than skipping. `--reset-hooks-path` unsets
// `core.hooksPath` globally, silently disarming every other repo that relies on it;
// `--force` writes this repo's wrappers into that shared directory, breaking those repos loudly.
// Neither is a thing a `prepare` script gets to decide on a developer's behalf.
//
// So: install when git would run `.git/hooks`, skip and say so otherwise. Skipping is not silent,
// because a gate nobody knows is off is the failure mode this whole checkout is built to avoid —
// hooks under a custom path run only if that path delegates back, and this script cannot know
// whether it does.
