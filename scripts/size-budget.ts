// Bundle-size budgets for the publishable build.
//
// Two numbers, because they answer two different questions.
//
// The **total** is every emitted `dist/**/*.js`: what ships in the tarball, and the tripwire
// against accidental bloat (an errant dependency inlined, dead code shipped).
//
// The **per-entry** numbers are what a consumer actually loads. Each public subpath in
// `package.json`'s `exports` is walked transitively through its static imports; the closure is the
// set of modules that must be present for that entry to evaluate. It is a lower bound on any
// bundler's answer, since `sideEffects: false` lets a bundler prune *within* these modules and
// never add to them. It is also the only number that notices the failures that matter here:
// a codec acquiring a value-import of something it previously needed only as a type, or the model
// reaching into a parser. The total cannot see either; both leave it unchanged.
//
// Budgets are tripwires, not targets. Raise one deliberately, with the same eyes a dependency
// addition would get. When you do, say in the commit *what* the entry gained.
//
// Run by the `size` gate of `verify --full`, which builds first, as well as by `prepublishOnly`.
// It used to be the publish step's alone, and `/customui` spent a release 3 KB over its budget on a
// tree that was green everywhere anyone looked: a budget only the publish step checks is not a
// tripwire. `docs/architecture.md` ("The size budgets are per entry") carries the reasoning.

// Roughly a tenth of headroom over the measured closure, per entry: enough that ordinary growth is
// not a chore, tight enough that a whole codec crossing a boundary cannot hide inside it.
//
// Every number below was halved when `build` split into two tsc passes and the JS pass started
// stripping comments. That is not a budget cut: nothing left the closure, and no consumer loads a
// byte less than they did before the prose was measured as part of it. It is the measurement
// finally being of code. The old figures were ~47% comment, which is what had made this tripwire
// soft: a codec crossing a boundary is the failure these numbers exist to catch, and at the old
// scale one could have arrived inside a release's ordinary comment churn without moving them.
//
// Re-baselined again when the browser boundary landed (ADR 0040), because two things moved at once
// and in opposite directions. `src/sha512.ts` and `toBase64` replaced `node:crypto` and `Buffer`,
// which puts about 5 KB into the bottom layer that every entry reaching `/core` now carries, and
// `/customui`, which reaches almost nothing, went over a budget with 0.7 KB left in it. Meanwhile
// the streaming writer left `.` and `/xlsx` for `/node`, so those two fell. The tenth of headroom
// this comment describes had been eaten to a rounding error on several entries (`/core` sat 0.1 KB
// under its number); the figures below restore it against today's measurement rather than
// grandfathering the drift. `/errors` and `/vba` keep theirs, which are already deliberate.
//
// Re-baselined once more by the write-path and error-taxonomy corrections. Four small primitives
// landed below several entries at once and each is on a path those entries actually take:
// `elementRange` (editing a part at scanner-found offsets instead of by regular expression),
// `assertWritableNumber` and `formulaNumberLiteral` (a formula literal has a serialisation of its
// own, and the BIFF12 codec produces it), `read-repair.ts` and `xml-chars.ts` (the reader no longer
// hands a file-derived value to a guard written about the caller). Nothing crossed a boundary; four
// entries had simply been left sitting at a few tenths of a percent of headroom, which is not the
// tripwire this comment describes. The numbers below restore it against today's measurement.

  // were each copied with a spread, which shares everything one level down, so the plans and their
  // exhaustiveness proofs are the fix rather than an addition. They sit in `core/style.ts`, which
  // every entry carries, and this was the one entry whose headroom the ~3 KB exhausted. Restores it
  // against that measurement rather than granting the growth a permanent home in the margin.
  './xlsb': 293,
  // Raised from 210 when the CSV writer's private moment.js-style date table was replaced by a real
  // Excel number-format renderer (ADR 0041). It is the one entry that pays for it: the renderer sits
  // in `core/date-format.ts` apart from `core/date.ts` precisely so the four entries that never
  // render a date do not carry four kilobytes of month names and grammar.
  './csv': 216,
  // The streaming writer and the write half it rides on, and nothing of the reader: a jump here is
  // the read path arriving, which would mean the entry had stopped being about one thing.
  //
  // Raised from 395 when the reader stopped handing file-derived names straight to the model's
  // authoring guards. `io/xlsx/read-repair.ts` and `xml/xml-chars.ts` are the two new modules, ~2 KB
  // between them, and both are on the untrusted-input path rather than beside it: without them a
  // corrupt package raised an `AuthoringError` blaming the caller, or a native `SyntaxError` the
  // taxonomy cannot see at all. This entry had 2.2 KB left in it, which is a rounding error and not
  // the headroom described above; the new figure restores it against today's measurement.
  //
  // Raised again, from 405, by the module seams: `worksheet-merges.ts`, `workbook-media.ts`,
  // `font-xml.ts` and `xml-attrs.ts` are four slices lifted out of files that had grown past what
  // anyone can read, and the code inside them did not change. What a module costs that a block of a
  // larger file does not is its import statements and its export keywords, which came to about
  // 2.4 KB across the four. Paying that for four seams is the trade this project takes; noticing it
  // is what the tripwire is for.
  './node': 413,
  // Raised from 50 when the MS-OVBA encoder stopped rescanning its whole back-window for every
  // output byte. The hash chain that replaced the rescan is the cost, and it buys a time bound on a
  // path an untrusted `.xlsm` reaches through `removeVbaModule`; the CFB and `dir` guards landed
  // alongside it are the rest. Restores this entry's tenth of headroom against that measurement.
  './vba': 56,

  // The taxonomy reaches nothing but itself, and that is the point: classifying a failure must
  // not cost a parser. A jump here means an error class started importing the layer it describes.
