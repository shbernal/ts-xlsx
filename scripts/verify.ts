// One entrypoint for the verification gates, run concurrently.
//
// The gates are independent processes with no shared state, so running them in
// sequence only buys the illusion of tidiness: it costs the sum of their times
// instead of the maximum. Assembling the chain by hand also lets gates go missing:
// `docs:check` and `constitution:check` are the two that get forgotten, because they
// are the two that rarely fail.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/verify.ts [--full | --quick] [--jobs <n>] [--list] [--cached]
//
//   --full        every gate, the same set lefthook runs pre-push and CI enforces.
//                 The default, because a bare invocation must never quietly skip the spine.
//   --quick       the inner loop: types, unit tests, and lint scoped to the files you
//                 have actually touched. No corpus, so it is not a substitute for --full.
//   --jobs <n>    how many gates to run at once (default 2; see runPool).
//   --list        print this mode's gate names and exit, without running them.
//   --cached      exit 0 immediately if this exact tree already passed this mode
//                 (see treeKey); otherwise run, and record the pass on success.
//
// Call this directly with `node`, not through `pnpm run`: the package-manager wrapper
// costs ~0.84 s per invocation, which is a tenth of the whole --quick budget.
