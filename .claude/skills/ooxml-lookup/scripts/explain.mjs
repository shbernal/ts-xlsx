/**
 * Resolve a validator diagnostic against the schema graph.
 *
 * This is the tool the incumbent cannot ship, because it needs a local graph to
 * answer "and what *would* have been legal here". It is also the loop agents
 * are actually stuck in: a validator says a child is unexpected, and the next
 * question is always "then what may go there, and in what order".
 *
 * ## What it consumes, and why so little
 *
 * Four fields of `ooxml-validate`'s JSON diagnostic:
 *
 *     { id: "Sch_UndeclaredAttribute", type: "Schema",
 *       description: "The 'bogus' attribute is not declared.",
 *       partUri: "/ppt/slides/slide1.xml", xpath: "/p:sld[1]" }
 *
 * Element identity and position come from `xpath`. The violated constraint
 * comes from `id`, a finite Open XML SDK enum. Only the quoted names inside
 * `description` need text handling, and that is a bounded regex per id rather
 * than a grammar.
 *
 * Reading exactly four fields is the deliberate mitigation for a **cross-repo
 * contract**: `ooxml-validate` is pre-1.0 and does not freeze its report shape,
 * so anything outside those four moving is a non-event here. Do not widen this
 * to consume the whole report — `AGENTS.md` says so, and this is the code that
 * paragraph is about.
 *
 * ## What it is not
 *
 * It **consumes** validator output, it does not produce it. No validation
 * happens here, nothing is imported from `ooxml-validate`, and nothing needs it
 * installed — consuming a data shape is not a dependency. The boundary in
 * `AGENTS.md` holds.
 */

/**
 * Diagnostic classes this resolves, and how to read each one.
 *
 * An explicit allowlist, not a `Sch_*` prefix match: the prefix covers plenty
 * of ids that are not about structure, and pretending to resolve one of those
 * would produce a confident answer to a question we did not understand.
 *
 * `extract` pulls the quoted names out of `description`. The Open XML SDK
 * phrases these consistently, but the regexes are anchored loosely on purpose —
 * a missed capture degrades to "here is what is legal here", which is still the
 * useful half.
 *
 * `summary` therefore takes `name` as `string | null` and **every template must
 * handle null**, because a missed capture is a normal outcome rather than an
 * edge case. Substituting a placeholder into the quoted slot is not an option:
 * `The 'it' attribute is not allowed on x:sheet` reads as a real attribute
 * called `it`, which is a confident answer to a question we did not understand.
 * The nameless phrasing also has to match what `resolveLegal` returns — without
 * a name it cannot narrow to one attribute's value space, so those two ids
 * promise the attribute list instead.
