// Cluster: tables
//
// Real-world scenario: an Excel table can hold a CALCULATED column — one where every body cell shares
// a single formula. Excel records that formula once, on the column definition, as a
// `<calculatedColumnFormula>` child of the `<tableColumn>` element (not as a formula on each cell).
// A reader must consume that nested element and keep enumerating the remaining columns. The legacy
// table-column reader instead loses its place at the nested element: it stops collecting columns after
// the first calculated one, so the table's column list is truncated, and reconciling the sheet's
// autoFilter against the short list then dereferences a column that is not there
// ("Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'filterButton')") — the whole workbook fails to load.
//
// The fixture is a three-column table (Qty, Double, Label) whose middle column, Double, is calculated
// (`Sales[Qty]*2`). A correct reader loads all three columns without error.
