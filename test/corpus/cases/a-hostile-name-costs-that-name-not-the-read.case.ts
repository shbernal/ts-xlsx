// Real-world scenario: a `.xlsx` this library did not write names a sheet twice, names one nothing
// at all, puts a `/` in one, runs one past 31 characters, or calls a table `1 bad`. Excel repairs
// every one of those on load. The reader used to hand each straight to the model's authoring guards
// and let the refusal out: an `AuthoringError`, which the taxonomy defines as "the calling code is
// wrong, never the input file", or -- worse for the two table names -- a native `SyntaxError` or
// `RangeError`, which `catch (e) { if (e instanceof XlsxError) … }` does not see at all, so the
// caller cannot tell "your file is broken" from "my own code threw".
//
// The rule this locks: a name the model refuses costs that name or the feature carrying it, never
// the read. A sheet keeps its cells and its place in the order under a repaired name -- dropping it
// would take every `localSheetId` indexing past it with it -- while a table or a defined name, whose
// name is its identity, is dropped whole. And the model that comes back is one this library can
// still write.
