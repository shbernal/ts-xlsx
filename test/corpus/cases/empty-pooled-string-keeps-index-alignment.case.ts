// Real-world scenario: `xl/sharedStrings.xml` is an index-aligned table. A `t="s"` cell carries an
// ordinal into it and nothing else, and producers spell an empty pooled string two legal ways:
// `<si><t/></si>` and the self-closing `<si/>`. A reader whose parser fires no close for a
// self-closing element commits no entry for the second form, so the pool it builds is one short and
// every cell indexing past that point resolves to its *neighbour's* string. The same table is where
// an empty `<v/>` on a `t="s"` cell lands: read through a bare `Number()`, the empty string is 0, an
// integer, so the cell resolves to the first pooled string.
//
// Both are the worst failure this library has: not a missing value, a different one. A downstream
// consumer sees a plausible string in every cell and has no way to tell it is the wrong one.
