# Migrating from ExcelJS

`ts-xlsx` is a hard fork of ExcelJS, but **it is not a drop-in replacement** and does
not try to be. The API is deliberately different because the goal of the fork was the
*right* shape, not the familiar one (see [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) §1). This page maps
the common ExcelJS patterns to their `ts-xlsx` equivalents so a port is mechanical, and
is honest about what has not been rebuilt yet.

Treat this as a translation guide, not a compatibility promise. Pin a version; the
surface is still moving toward a `0.x` release.

## The three shifts that cover most code

### 1. I/O is synchronous and byte-native — free functions, not `workbook.xlsx.*`

ExcelJS routed I/O through async methods on the workbook that assumed Node `Buffer`s and
streams. `ts-xlsx` reads and writes plain `Uint8Array` synchronously, so the same call
works in Node and the browser and there is nothing to `await` for the buffered path.

```ts
// ExcelJS
const wb = new ExcelJS.Workbook();
await wb.xlsx.readFile('in.xlsx');
await wb.xlsx.writeFile('out.xlsx');
const buf = await wb.xlsx.writeBuffer();

// ts-xlsx — I/O is separate from the model, synchronous, and Uint8Array in/out
import {Workbook, readXlsx, writeXlsx} from '@shbernal/ts-xlsx';
import {readFileSync, writeFileSync} from 'node:fs';

const wb = readXlsx(readFileSync('in.xlsx'));
writeFileSync('out.xlsx', writeXlsx(wb));
const bytes = writeXlsx(wb); // Uint8Array
```

Reading and writing files from disk is the caller's job — `ts-xlsx` never touches the
filesystem, which is what keeps it browser-safe.

### 2. Cell values are one precisely-typed union

ExcelJS overloaded `cell.value` loosely and expressed types like formulas, hyperlinks,
and rich text as ad-hoc object shapes. In `ts-xlsx`, `cell.value` is the single
[`CellValue`](api/cell-values.md) union — `number | string | boolean | Date | null`
plus typed formula, rich-text, hyperlink, and error shapes. `null` is the empty cell.

```ts
sheet.getCell('A1').value = 42;
sheet.getCell('A2').value = new Date();
sheet.getCell('A3').value = {formula: 'SUM(A1:A2)', result: 42};
sheet.getCell('A4').value = null; // empty
```

### 3. Absent axes are `undefined`, never sentinels

A whole-row reference (`$1`) has no column; a whole-column reference (`$A:$A`) has no
row. ExcelJS let those decay into `NaN`/`"undefined"` and leak into serialized addresses.
`ts-xlsx` models an omitted axis as `undefined` on
[`CellAddress`](api/addresses-ranges.md) and never fabricates a sentinel.

## Quick reference

| ExcelJS | ts-xlsx |
| --- | --- |
| `await wb.xlsx.readFile(path)` | `readXlsx(readFileSync(path))` |
| `await wb.xlsx.load(buffer)` | `readXlsx(bytes)` |
| `await wb.xlsx.writeFile(path)` | `writeFileSync(path, writeXlsx(wb))` |
| `await wb.xlsx.writeBuffer()` | `writeXlsx(wb)` → `Uint8Array` |
| `await wb.csv.readFile(path)` | `readCsv(readFileSync(path, 'utf8'))` |
| `await wb.csv.writeBuffer()` | `writeCsv(wb)` / `writeCsvText(wb)` |
| `wb.addWorksheet('S')` | `wb.addWorksheet('S')` *(unchanged)* |
| `wb.getWorksheet('S')` | `wb.getWorksheet('S')` → `Worksheet \| undefined` |
| `sheet.getCell('A1').value = …` | `sheet.getCell('A1').value = …` *(unchanged)* |
| `sheet.addRow([…])` | `sheet.addRow([…])` *(unchanged)* |
| streaming `WorkbookReader` | `readSheetRows(bytes, {sheet})` / `readWorkbookStream(bytes)` |

Where a method name is unchanged, its types are still stricter — `getWorksheet` returns
`Worksheet | undefined` (handle the miss), and the arguments are precisely typed.

## What is not here (yet)

The rewrite is corpus-driven: a surface lands only once it is strict-typed and pinned by
tests. Some ExcelJS features are still on the way, and the buffered writer refuses a
value it cannot represent faithfully rather than emitting a lossy package. If you depend
on a feature not yet in the [API reference](api/README.md), check
[`STRATEGY.md`](../STRATEGY.md) for where it sits in the plan — and, per the project's
working agreement, a missing behavior is best reported as a corpus case so it is fixed
once and never regresses.

## Why break compatibility at all?

Because keeping the old surface would make the library worse but easier, and replacing it
makes the library better but harder — and the fork exists to do the harder, better thing
([`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) §5). You get types that are the documentation, an I/O model
that works unchanged in the browser, and a codebase where every behavior is a green
check rather than a hopeful assumption.
