# Granting sort/AutoFilter on a protected sheet needs an unlocked window, not just the flag

Cluster: protection

## Scenario

An author protects a worksheet where most cells are locked, but wants end users to still sort and
filter the data range without unprotecting the sheet. They enable the `sort` and `autoFilter`
permissions when turning on protection and expect sorting to work. It doesn't: the application still
refuses to sort, because sorting rewrites cell values and the cells are locked. A sheet protected
*manually* in Excel behaves differently only because the user typically also left the sortable range
unlocked, or used Allow-Edit-Ranges. The reported "programmatic against manual" gap is not a hidden
format quirk. It is which cells are left unlocked and which protection surface is emitted.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: the flag *encoding* is already correct and locked by
> `sheet-protection-permits-requested-operations`, where granting sort emits `sort="0"`. What is
> missing is the higher-level semantics: the flag alone is insufficient, and the fix requires either
> per-cell unlock state or a `<protectedRanges>` editable window, neither of which the library models
> as an authoring surface. The exact attribute-plus-lock combination the application honors must be
> verified empirically before any assertion; this records the design target.

## Desired behavior

- **A protected sheet with sort and AutoFilter granted actually permits those operations** in the
  application, matching a manually-protected sheet, rather than merely setting the permission
  attributes.
- **The mechanism is an unlocked window, not just a flag.** Sort and AutoFilter over a protected range
  require that the reorderable data cells are themselves unlocked (`locked=false`), or that a
  `<protectedRanges>` entry carves out an editable region within the otherwise-protected sheet.
  Setting `sort` and `autoFilter` on `<sheetProtection>` while every covered cell stays locked is not
  enough, and the application still refuses to reorder locked cells.
- **The OOXML surface involved:** the `<sheetProtection>` attributes (`sort`, `autoFilter`,
  `formatCells`, the `sheet` flag), the per-cell and per-style `locked` protection property, and
  optionally `<protectedRanges>` definitions.

## Open questions

- Should the library expose a high-level convenience, a `sortableRange` or `allowEdit` option on
  protection, that automatically unlocks the relevant cells or emits a protected range, so the
  common case "protect everything but let users sort this table" works without the author toggling
  per-cell lock state by hand?
- What exact `<sheetProtection>` attribute combination and cell-lock state does the target
  application require to honor sort and AutoFilter? Verify empirically against real files.
- How should `<protectedRanges>`, the OOXML "unlocked window inside a protected sheet" mechanism, be
  modeled in the public API?
