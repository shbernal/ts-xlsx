# Conditional formatting: string-literal quoting and per-cell expression translation

Cluster: conditional-formatting

## Scenario

A user wants a fill applied to cells whose value equals a short string (e.g. `"T"`) via a
conditional-formatting rule. They reach for a `cellIs` rule with operator `equal` and a `formulae`
entry of `T`, but the resulting workbook applies the fill to the wrong cells (notably all blank
cells), because the bare token `T` is emitted as a defined-name/reference rather than a quoted string
literal. Users find that switching to an `expression` rule with a relative formula like `A2="T"`
works — the relative address, anchored at the range's top-left, is translated per-cell across the
range so each cell is compared to its own value. (A separate confusion in the thread is a viewer
rendering difference between applications, not a library defect.)

> Spec note, not a corpus case: the durable value is the CF-rule authoring contract — how a string
> literal must be quoted and how relative references in an expression rule are translated — rather
> than a single malformed-output assertion. The corpus already round-trips CF rules
> (`databar-conditional-formatting-roundtrip`, `conditional-formatting-multi-area-ref-survives`,
> `extended-conditional-formatting-expression-rule-roundtrip`); this note pins the semantics.

## Desired behavior

- **`cellIs` string literals are quoted.** For a `cellIs` rule with `equal` (and the other comparison
  operators), an operand intended as a string literal is serialized as an OOXML **quoted string**
  (`"T"`), not a bare token Excel resolves as a defined name/reference. A bare unquoted token
  currently produces a formula that matches empty/blank cells — a silent correctness bug.
- **Expression rules translate relative references per-cell.** For an `expression` rule, formulae with
  relative cell references (e.g. `A2="T"`) are anchored at the **top-left cell of the rule's ref
  range** and translated per-cell across the whole range, matching Excel's shared-formula-style
  relative translation for conditional formatting. This is what makes a per-row rule evaluate each
  row against its own cell.
- The API makes the string-literal-vs-reference distinction **unambiguous** so a caller does not have
  to know OOXML quoting rules to compare against a literal.

## Open questions

- Does the library auto-quote a `cellIs` operand that is a plain string (least-surprise), or require
  the caller to pass a quoted literal explicitly, or offer a typed `{literal: 'T'}` vs
  `{ref: 'A2'}` discriminator?
- How is numeric-vs-string operand intent disambiguated for `cellIs equal` (compare-to-number vs
  compare-to-text)?
- Per-cell translation: is the anchor always the range's top-left, and how are absolute `$`
  references left untranslated as expected?
