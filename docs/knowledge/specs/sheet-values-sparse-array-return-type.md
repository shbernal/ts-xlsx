# The sheet-values accessor returns row values, not Row objects

Cluster: types

Reported as "getSheetValues() typescript definition is incorrect".

## Desired behavior

The worksheet accessor that returns "all rows as a sparse array" must have a return type that precisely matches its runtime output. It does **not** return `Row` objects; it returns each row's *values*.

Each element is a row's value payload, which in this model can be either:

- a sparse, 1-indexed array of cell values, where index `0` is empty and index `n` is the value of column `n`, or
- a keyed object `{ [columnKey: string]: CellValue }` when the row was populated via column keys.

The outer array is itself sparse: it is 1-indexed by row number, with holes for empty or absent rows.

## Prior art / prior discussion

- The original declaration typed the result as `Row[]`, which is wrong, because callers would reach for `Row` members that do not exist at runtime.
- One suggested fix was `Cell[][]`, also wrong, since elements are raw cell *values* rather than `Cell` objects, and a row can be a keyed object rather than an array.
- Another suggested `any[]`, which is rejected on principle in this project, because `any` erases the contract.
- The accurate shape mirrors the existing row-values union used elsewhere in the model: `type RowValues = CellValue[] | { [columnKey: string]: CellValue }`, giving a sparse result of `RowValues[]`.

## Recommended shape for ts-xlsx

- Introduce or reuse a named `RowValues`, or equivalently named, union: `CellValue[] | { [columnKey: string]: CellValue }`.
- Type the accessor's return as a sparse array of `RowValues`, where both the outer array and inner arrays are sparse and 1-indexed, and document the index-0 hole.
- Cover with a type-level test asserting the return type is assignable to and from the sparse `RowValues[]` shape and is NOT `Row[]`.

## The same union types `row.values` and `column.values`, not just the sheet accessor

The sparse `RowValues` shape is not confined to the whole-sheet accessor. The per-`Row` `values`
property is the same 1-indexed sparse array, or keyed object, and the per-`Column` `values`
property is the column's cells read top-to-bottom as a sparse array. Both are `RowValues`-shaped
collections of `CellValue`, **never a scalar**. A published declaration once typed `Column.values`
as `string`, the result of a refactor that meant only to drop a `readonly` modifier, which is
doubly wrong: it is an array, not a string, and its elements are `CellValue`, not text. A caller
indexing `column.values[3]` then got a `string` character instead of the cell value, or a type error.

- `Row.values` and `Column.values` are typed as the shared sparse `RowValues`
  (`CellValue[] | { [columnKey: string]: CellValue }` for a row; a sparse `CellValue[]` for a
  column), consistent with the whole-sheet accessor. One union, used everywhere row and column value
  payloads surface, so the three accessors cannot drift apart.
- A scalar type (`string`, `any`) on any `.values` member is a defect, since the runtime always yields
  the sparse collection. A type-level test pins each `.values` member to the `RowValues` or
  sparse-array shape so a future refactor cannot silently narrow it to a scalar again.

## Open questions

- Should the sparse, 1-indexed nature be encoded more strongly, say a branded `SparseArray<T>`, or just documented? A branded type is more honest but heavier for consumers; document the 1-indexing at minimum.
- When a fresh, modern API is designed for this fork, consider whether a dense, 0-indexed structure or an explicit `{ rowNumber, values }[]` is a better shape than perpetuating the legacy sparse array.
