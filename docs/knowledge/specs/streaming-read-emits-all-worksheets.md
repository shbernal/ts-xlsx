# Streaming read must emit every worksheet, including large sheet counts

Cluster: streaming

## Scenario

A workbook with a large number of worksheets (well over 100 — one report cites ~188) is read with
the streaming reader. The streaming reader should emit every worksheet the workbook declares, in
order, and complete without stalling. In practice the many-sheet path is unreliable: worksheets
are dropped, or enumeration crashes.

> A synthesized 150-sheet workbook fed through the streaming reader crashes in the worksheet
> parser (`this.model.sheets` is undefined for a worksheet), indicating the workbook model is not
> reliably available before worksheets are parsed when there are many sheets. The originally
> attached repro file is a broken HTML download (not a zip), so the exact reported symptom
> ("drops worksheets") could not be reproduced from it — captured here as desired behavior rather
> than a corpus case with a fragile assertion.

## Desired behavior

- Streaming-reading a workbook with any number of worksheets emits a worksheet for **every** sheet
  part the workbook declares — the count surfaced equals the count of declared sheets.
- Worksheets are emitted in workbook order, each discoverable by its declared name.
- Enumeration completes (the stream never stalls) regardless of sheet count.
- The workbook-level model (sheet list, relationships, shared strings) needed to resolve a
  worksheet must be available *before* that worksheet is emitted — parsing order must guarantee it,
  so a worksheet handler never dereferences an unpopulated model.
- **Foreign-generated workbooks keep their sheet names.** A file emitted by a non-Excel producer
  (openpyxl was the reported generator) was streamed with its worksheet *names* lost — the sheets
  emitted, but each `name` came back empty or wrong because the streaming reader bound names by an
  Excel-specific assumption the foreign `workbook.xml` did not satisfy. Names must be resolved from
  the workbook part's declared sheet list (via the relationship graph), so a streamed worksheet
  carries the same name the buffered reader would surface. This is the streaming analogue of
  `worksheet-enumeration-tolerates-foreign-generators`.
- **Stream end is deterministic — it fires only when the input is truly exhausted.** The row/worksheet
  iteration signalled completion early under a race: the underlying stream reported "ended" while more
  data was still in flight, so the last rows (or a whole trailing worksheet) were silently dropped,
  non-deterministically. The reader must not treat a transient drain / pause as end-of-input; a
  worksheet is complete only when its part is fully consumed, and the workbook stream is complete only
  when every declared part has been. Because the failure is a timing-dependent race, its regression
  guard belongs in a stress/soak harness (repeated runs under artificial chunk fragmentation), not a
  single deterministic corpus fixture.

## Open questions

- Ordering guarantee: does the streaming reader parse `workbook.xml` + `_rels` fully before
  emitting any worksheet, or lazily? The crash above suggests the model must be resolved first.
- Memory: many sheets must not force the whole workbook into memory — only the workbook-level
  index (small) plus the current worksheet's bounded window. Ties into
  `bounded-memory-large-workbook-read`.
- Error semantics if a declared sheet part is missing or unreadable — skip-with-signal vs. throw.
- A regression check for this belongs in a harness that can synthesize an N-sheet workbook and
  assert `emitted === declared`, since a durable fixture would be large.
