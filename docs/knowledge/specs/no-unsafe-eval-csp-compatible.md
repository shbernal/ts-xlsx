# CSP-safe: no eval, no `new Function`, no `Function(...)`

Cluster: security

Reported as "Uncaught EvalError: 'unsafe-eval' is not an allowed source of script".

## Desired behavior

The library must run correctly in browser-adjacent environments (web pages, Manifest V3 extensions, Electron renderers) under a strict Content Security Policy, specifically `script-src 'self'` with **no** `'unsafe-eval'` allowance. Loading and using any public entry point (read, write, CSV, zip) must not trigger `EvalError`.

Concretely:
- The shipped source and every bundled artifact must contain **zero** dynamic code evaluation: no `eval`, no `new Function(...)`, no `Function(...)` call constructor, no `setTimeout("string", …)`, no bundler-injected module-globals via `new Function`.
- This must hold for all published entry points and bundles, not just an opt-in "bare" build. There must be no configuration where the default import path pulls in eval-based polyfills.

## Prior art / root causes seen in the wild

The eval usage in the legacy library came entirely from tooling and transitive dependencies, never from spreadsheet logic:

1. Browserify's module-globals injection wraps modules with `new Function` to synthesize `global` and `process` shims.
2. `regenerator-runtime` intentionally escapes accidental strict mode via `Function("r", "regeneratorRuntime = r")(runtime)`, triggered only when the bundle is force-strict, which browserify plus babel produced.
3. `declare.js`, reached transitively through the CSV parsing dependency, used `new Function`.
4. The legacy zip dependency's browserify wrapper also emitted `new Function`.

Community workarounds, all unsatisfactory: widen CSP to allow `unsafe-eval`, which defeats CSP; alias to a "bare" bundle and import `regenerator-runtime` separately; or `sed` out `"use strict"` from the shipped dist.

## Why this is (mostly) obsolete-by-construction for ts-xlsx

ts-xlsx is a TypeScript-first rewrite targeting native async/await, with no regenerator runtime, a small modern dependency tree and a modern bundler, so there is no browserify module-globals injection. Choosing an eval-free zip/deflate dependency and an eval-free CSV parser eliminates every historical source of the problem. The remaining work is to make CSP-safety a *guarded invariant* rather than an accident.

## Concrete requirements to carry forward

- Select dependencies (zip/inflate, CSV) that are documented CSP-safe and contain no `new Function` or `eval`. Reject any dependency, direct or transitive, that introduces dynamic evaluation.
- Do not rely on `regenerator-runtime`; target runtimes with native generators and async.
- Add a **build-time guard** in CI that scans every published artifact, across all entry points and bundles, for `eval(`, `new Function` and `Function(` call-constructor usage, and fails the build if any is found. This makes CSP-safety a machine-checked green check rather than a promise.

## Open questions

- What is the minimum supported runtime baseline? It determines whether any transpilation or polyfill is ever needed, which is where eval historically crept in.
- Do we ship separate browser and node bundles, and if so, is the CSP scan applied to both? It should be.
- Should the CSP guarantee be asserted with an actual headless-browser test under `script-src 'self'`, the strongest signal, in addition to the static scan?
