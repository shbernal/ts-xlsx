# Declarative multi-level (nested) column headers

Cluster: core-model / DX

## Scenario

Reports frequently need **grouped, multi-level headers**: a top banner ("Q1") spanning several
sub-columns ("Jan", "Feb", "Mar"), possibly several levels deep. Producing these today means
dropping to low-level primitives — computing how many leaf columns each group spans, writing each
header row by hand, and manually merging every group cell across its span — for what is a
structurally regular, mechanical layout. The width of a parent header is just the aggregated leaf
count of its descendants; the depth of the header block is the tree height. Doing this by hand is
error-prone (off-by-one spans, forgotten merges) and does not compose with dynamic data whose
grouping is only known at runtime.

## Desired behavior

- A **declarative** way to define columns as a tree (each node has a label and either child nodes
  or a leaf binding — a `key`/value accessor and optional width/style). The library walks the tree,
  computes each node's span as the aggregate leaf count of its subtree, emits one header row per
  tree level, and merges each non-leaf header cell across its span automatically.
- Leaf columns produced by the tree behave like ordinary columns for everything downstream: keyed
  row population, widths, number formats, and cell styling all apply to the leaves.
- The generated header block composes cleanly with the rest of the sheet: data rows begin
  immediately below the deepest header row, and freezing/among the header rows works as if they had
  been authored by hand.
- Styling applies per node (a group header and its leaves can be styled independently), and the
  merged group cells carry borders/fills consistently with adjacent groups.

## Prior art / notes

- The proposed shape is a recursive column tree walked into a flat leaf list plus a per-level
  header plan; that flat list is exactly the existing column model, so nested headers can be a
  *builder* over the current primitives rather than a new core concept.
- The hard part is interaction with the rest of the feature set — merged cells, borders on merged
  regions, per-node styles, and shared column keys — which is why this belongs in the design phase
  rather than as a mechanical corpus lock.

## Open questions

- Tree input shape: nested objects/arrays, or a fluent builder? How are leaf `key`s spelled
  (see `nested-property-path-column-keys` for the record-binding side)?
- How do borders and fills resolve across a merged group header — inherited from the group node,
  or composed from the leaves?
- Does the feature own row freezing of the header block, or leave that to the caller?
