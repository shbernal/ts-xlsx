# Extended (x14) conditional-formatting rules must round-trip with their formula and extended dxf

Cluster: conditional-formatting

## Scenario

Modern Excel stores certain conditional-formatting rules in a worksheet **extension block** rather
than the classic conditional-formatting collection. These extended rules can be of type
`expression`, where the trigger condition is a formula carried in a nested formula element, and their
applied formatting is described by a **differential-formatting (dxf) child that lives inside the
extension namespace** — an *extended* dxf, distinct from the classic dxf used by ordinary
conditional formatting. When a workbook containing such an extended expression rule is read and
written back, two things must survive: the rule's condition formula, and the extended dxf that
describes the visual formatting. If the extended dxf is dropped on write, the rule is preserved
structurally but becomes a **visual no-op** — Excel opens the file with the rule present but applying
no formatting at all.

## Desired behavior

- An extended conditional-formatting rule of type `expression` **preserves its condition formula**
  through a read/write round-trip.
- The rule **preserves its extended differential-formatting (dxf) child**, so the applied formatting
  is never silently dropped into a no-op.
- On write, the differential-formatting node is emitted **in the extension namespace** (an extended
  dxf) — not omitted, and not confused with or downgraded to the classic conditional-formatting dxf.
- Classic and extended rule families should merge into a **single conceptual model on read** (the
  formula on an extended expression rule is handled the same way as the formula on a classic rule),
  so callers see one coherent conditional-formatting surface regardless of where a rule was stored.

## Open questions

- Should extended rules the library does not fully model be **passed through** verbatim on write
  (preserving the raw extension block) until a first-class model exists, so nothing is dropped in the
  interim?
- Which extended rule types beyond `expression` (data bars with extended options, icon sets, color
  scales with extension attributes) share this extension-block storage and need the same treatment?
- How are the extension-block dxf records reconciled with the classic `dxfs` table on write —
  separate tables, or a merged one with namespace-aware emission?
- The **copy path** loses the extension too: reading a sheet's conditional formattings and replaying
  a rule onto another sheet (`newSheet.addConditionalFormatting(rule)`) drops the x14 extension,
  because the read-side model exposes only the classic rule fields (`type`, `operator`, `formulae`,
  …) and not the extended-namespace payload. Preserving x14 on a read→re-add→write copy needs the
  same first-class (or pass-through) extension model — the copy is not a separate bug, it is the same
  model gap surfacing through the authoring API rather than a raw round-trip.
