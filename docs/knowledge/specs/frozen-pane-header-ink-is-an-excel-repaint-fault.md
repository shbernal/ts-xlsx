# A frozen pane's header ink can go missing until the cell is clicked, and no package can prevent it

Cluster: worksheet

## Scenario

The shape this library writes for almost every report — a banner row, a header row beneath it,
`freeze(2)` over the pair, and a table whose `autoFilter` puts a dropdown button on every header
cell — renders with header text missing on some columns. The affected cells hold their values
(the formula bar shows them); only the ink is absent. Clicking a blank header paints it and blanks
a different one, so the set of drawn headers changes but its size does not.

The reflex on a report like this is to suspect the package: a malformed `<pane>`, a font colour
that collapses into its fill, a header clipped by a row height too small for its wrapped text.
All three were checked and all three are wrong. This note records the measurement so the next
agent does not re-derive it, and — more usefully — records the control that settles it, because
the fault is not reproducible by any means this repo can automate.

## The control: an Excel-authored package reproduces it

The decisive test is not "does our file do this" but "does a file *Excel wrote* do this".
`tools/excel-oracle/observe.ps1` opened the reported workbook over COM and re-saved it —
`openThrew: false`, `repaired: false`, so Excel took the package as given rather than recovering it
— producing a copy whose every byte is Excel's own serialization of the same content.

**The fault reproduces in that package**, confirmed by the reporter on the machine that showed it
originally. Nothing this library emits is in the causal path: the same content, serialized by the
application that renders it, renders the same way.

## Measured behavior: the package is right, and synthetic navigation cannot see the fault

Excel Desktop (Microsoft 365, version 16.0, build 20228.0, Windows). The workbook: two sheets
frozen at `ySplit="2"` (one also `xSplit="1"`), 13 and 18 columns, each a table with an
`autoFilter` across the header row, header cells bold 9pt `FFFFFFFF` on a solid `FF009EE0` fill,
row height 34 with `wrapText`.

| Hypothesis | Check | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Malformed `<pane>` | Diff ours against Excel's re-save | **Identical.** `<pane ySplit="2" topLeftCell="A3" activePane="bottomLeft" state="frozen"/>`, and the four-pane `xSplit="1" ySplit="2"` variant, come back byte-for-byte. Excel adds only empty `<selection>` elements for the panes it does not sit in. |
| Ink collapsing into the fill | Sample the rendered pixels in the frozen header band | Fill `#009EE0`, ink `#FFFFFF` — exactly what `styles.xml` states, at every position captured. |
| Header clipped by row height | `estimateWrappedLines` per header against its column width, less 2 character units for the dropdown button | Widest label needs 2 lines; 34pt holds 2. No header is clipped. |
| Fault visible under automation | 9 capture positions: COM `ScrollColumn`, `{RIGHT}` walks, `%{PGDN}`/`%{PGUP}` paging, both directions | White ink present in the header band at **every** position it was on screen (2.35%–4.73% of band pixels). Never blank. |

## Why the automation cannot see it, and why that is not a refutation

The symptom is *stateful*: clicking one header paints it and unpaints another. No property of a
package can make two cells mutually exclusive — a file describes cells, not a budget of them. That
signature belongs to the repaint path, and the repaint path is the one thing synthetic navigation
does not exercise faithfully. A COM `ScrollColumn` assignment and a `SendKeys` keystroke each force
a clean, settled repaint; the fault lives in incremental invalidation of the frozen region under
real scrolling.

This is the same boundary `rows-with-no-stated-height-are-autofitted-on-open` states about its own
"no blank bands" result: that note excluded blank bands *on an unfrozen sheet, under synthetic
navigation*, and explicitly could not exclude a frame shorter than its capture latency. The two
notes do not conflict. This one adds the case that method cannot reach — a frozen pane, and a
human scrolling it.

## What follows for the writer

**Nothing.** There is no change to the emitted package that is known to help, and the control above
is the reason: the fault survives Excel's own serialization. An agent tempted to "fix" this by
nudging the pane element, dropping `wrapText`, restating the row height, or moving the autoFilter
should read the control result first — every one of those changes would be a guess dressed as a
fix, and would leave a permanent distortion in the writer paying for a fault it does not cause.

The mitigation is client-side and belongs in advice to the reader, not in the file:

- **Disable hardware graphics acceleration** (File → Options → Advanced → Display). This is the
  standard remedy for Office repaint faults; the setting lives at
  `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Graphics\DisableHardwareAcceleration`, and its
  absence means the default — enabled — is in force.
- Update the display driver, or test in Excel safe mode to rule out an add-in.

## Provenance

`source: excel-desktop-verification`, the tier ADR-0013 describes. One Excel build, one host.

The package half is reproducible from the repo: re-save any frozen, autofiltered workbook with
`pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/excel-oracle/observe.ps1 -Path <wb.xlsx>` and diff
`xl/worksheets/*.xml` against the input. The rendering half needed the interactive tier — headless
COM paints nothing — and was taken by driving a visible Excel through the `excel-gui-automation`
skill (`Set-ExcelForeground` + window-rect-scoped `Save-WindowScreenshot`), then sampling the
header band's pixels. That half is a recorded observation, not reproducible from the repo, and its
fixtures were scratch files under `.tmp/`.

**The fault itself is a user report, not a repo measurement.** What this repo measured is that the
package is correct and that the fault survives Excel's own re-save. Anyone revisiting this should
start from the control, not from the writer.
