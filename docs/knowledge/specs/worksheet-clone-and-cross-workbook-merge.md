# Duplicating and merging worksheets must be a safe, first-class, deep-copy operation

Cluster: core-model / packaging

## Scenario

Two closely related needs recur with no first-class API:

- **Clone within a workbook.** A user has a sheet (often a loaded template) and wants an independent
  copy to edit, or wants to stamp out N copies of a template sheet into the same workbook.
- **Merge across workbooks.** A user builds sheets in separate workers/processes (to parallelize a
  large workbook) and wants to assemble the finished sheets into one output file — or simply combine
  two workbooks into one.

With no supported operation, users approximate it two ways, both unsound. Cloning by overwriting a
blank sheet's serialized `model` with the source's model: assigning by reference (or shallow copy)
shares the `name` and triggers a duplicate-name error, or leaves workbook metadata inconsistent so
the file opens with a recovery prompt (e.g. a named range still pointing at the original sheet). A
deep clone with the name reconciled works for the common case, but reporters find **embedded images
and merged cells do not reliably carry over**, and cross-workbook cloning is unreliable. Merging by
iterating a source sheet's rows and re-adding them to a destination fails too: the object read back
from a row is not the shape the add-row API consumes, and copying only values silently drops
styling, column widths, merges, notes, images, tables, and data validations.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: there is no clone/merge API yet, so there is nothing to assert

> case (`worksheet-model-preserves-merged-cells`); this note records the durable *requirement* for
> the real operation that should replace the workaround.

## Desired behavior

- A first-class, safe way to **duplicate a worksheet** into a workbook (clone under a new,
  auto-deduplicated name), and to **append/merge** a worksheet from another workbook. The clone is a
  **deep, independent copy** — mutating the copy never affects the source.
- **All sheet content survives**, not just cell values: values and formulas (including shared
  formulas), number formats, fonts/fills/borders/alignment, column widths and hidden state, row
  heights, **merged ranges**, notes/comments, **images/media**, tables, and data validations.
- **Workbook-scoped state is reconciled** so the result opens without repair: shared-string entries
  remapped/rebuilt; style indices translated into the destination's style table (deduplicating
  identical ones); sheet ids and names kept unique under a defined collision policy; relationship ids
  for images/tables/hyperlinks re-issued so they never clash with the destination's existing rels;
  defined names, sheet-scoped references, and print areas re-pointed or duplicated rather than left
  dangling at the original sheet.
- **Cross-sheet references** a moved sheet depends on are handled by a documented policy — at minimum,
  formulas referencing the moved sheet by its (possibly renamed) own name stay valid.
- **Name collisions never silently corrupt** — either reject with a clear error or auto-suffix
  deterministically.
- Optionally, a **portable single-sheet serialization** so sheets built in separate processes can be
  marshalled and reassembled; if exposed, it must round-trip losslessly through append/merge.

## Prior art / observed workarounds

- Deep-clone the serialized worksheet model, overwrite `name`, assign it back — works for values,
  columns, styles; **loses merges and media**, and corrupts named ranges if metadata is not
  reconciled.
- The row-by-row re-add approach misuses the add-row API (a read-back row is not an add-row input)
  and drops all formatting — any merge API must not rely on that pattern.
- The underlying "large single-sheet generation is slow" complaint is a *separate* concern; merge is
  requested to parallelize, not as a performance guarantee the library must make.

## Open questions

- Public surface: a workbook-level `cloneWorksheet(source, {name})` returning the new sheet, and/or a
  separate `importWorksheet(fromWorkbook, sheet)`?
- Collision policy for sheets and defined names: throw vs auto-suffix vs caller-specified, and is it
  configurable?
- Sheet-scoped defined names and inter-sheet formula references pointing at the source — rewrite to
  the clone, or leave pointing at the original?
- Cross-workbook merge of not-sheet-scoped artifacts (theme, calc properties, workbook views,
  workbook-level defined names): merge, prefer-destination, or error on conflict?
- Is a streaming/worker-friendly portable-sheet serialization in scope now or a later addition?
