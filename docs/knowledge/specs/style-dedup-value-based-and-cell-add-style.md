# Value-based style deduplication on write, and merging a style onto a cell

Cluster: styles

## Scenario

When writing large spreadsheets, every cell's style must be deduplicated into a shared table of cell
formats (`xf` records) so the same visual style is written once and referenced by index. A common
real-world pattern assigns styles inside loops (per-cell style literals) or combines column/row/cell
styles, which produces many distinct-but-equal style *objects*. A cache keyed on object *identity*
then fails to recognize these as equal: it grows unbounded with a near-zero hit rate, and write time
degrades severely — in one measured case a 200k-row × 7-column workbook took roughly 5× longer to
write with identity-keyed style caching than with styling disabled entirely. The cache actively hurt.
A value-based dedup key (a canonical, order-stable encoding of the style's effective properties)
recovers most of that cost, cutting the penalty to under 2×. Separately, users want to add/merge a
style onto a cell without discarding the column- and row-level styles the cell inherits.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: the durable value is a design proposal — how to deduplicate cell
> styles efficiently and correctly, plus a cell-merge ergonomic — not a current behavior to assert.
> The core correctness invariants (equal styles collapse; distinct styles never collide) are flagged
> as behavior intents for corpus coverage once the write path exists.

## Desired behavior

- **Value-based dedup is the single default.** Two style *values* that are structurally equal must map
  to the same shared `xf` record regardless of whether they are the same JS object. This makes the
  common patterns (per-cell literals in a loop; column+row+cell combinations) fast and memory-bounded
  with no user tuning. There is **no** user-facing cache-mode knob — an enum choosing between
  correct-and-fast and identity-based caching is exactly the legacy compatibility surface this fork
  rejects; the canonical value-encoding is the one code path.

- **The dedup key is collision-free.** Two structurally *different* styles must never encode to the
  same key, or cells would silently inherit the wrong formatting. This is a hard correctness invariant,
  independent of any performance concern, and must hold across the full effective style surface:
  number format, font, fill, border, alignment, and protection.

- **Merge a partial style onto a cell, respecting inheritance.** A caller can add/merge a partial style
  onto a cell so that only the explicitly provided properties override, while the column- and row-level
  properties the cell inherits are preserved. This contrasts with replacing `cell.style` wholesale,
  which drops inheritance. (Naming aside — `addStyle`/`mergeStyle` — the semantics are the load-bearing
  part.)

- **Styles are values, snapshotted at write.** Value-based dedup encodes each cell's *effective* style
  at write time, so mutating a shared style object after it was assigned to several cells is a separate,
  documented concern: styles should be treated as immutable values.

## Behavior intents (for later corpus coverage once the write path exists)

- Two cells assigned equal-but-distinct style objects produce a single shared `xf` entry, not two.
- Two cells with genuinely different styles produce two distinct `xf` entries and never collide onto
  each other's formatting after a round-trip.
- Assigning a style inside a loop (many independent equal style values) does not grow the style table
  proportionally to cell count.
- Merging a style onto a cell preserves the column- and row-level properties it inherits, overriding
  only the explicitly-set properties.

## Open questions

- Define the canonical style encoding precisely over the full effective-style surface so equality is
  total and collision-free; cover it with type-level and unit tests.
- How to expose the merge operation (a `cell.addStyle(partial)` method vs. a merge helper) and how it
  composes with the worksheet-default and named-style layers.
- Whether the same value-based encoding should back read-time style *interning* (so equal styles read
  from a file share one model object), not just write-time dedup.
