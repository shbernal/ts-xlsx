# PivotTable per-field aggregation metrics (Count and the rest, not just Sum)

Cluster: pivot

## Scenario

A user builds a pivot table and needs to choose, per value field, how it is aggregated. Spreadsheet
applications offer a family of aggregation functions — Sum, Count, Average, Max, Min, Product, and
more — and the pivot definition records which one applies to each value field. A library that can only
sum cannot express the very common case of **counting occurrences** in a field (how many rows fall
into each category), which is the natural reduction for non-numeric fields where Sum is meaningless.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: this extends the partial/unbuilt pivot-authoring feature — the durable
> value is the per-field aggregation model and its OOXML mapping, not an assertion against current
> behaviour. It becomes a corpus case once the authoring API accepts a metric per field and the
> written pivot definition's `dataField/@subtotal` is asserted. This complements the *multi-measure*
> axis captured in `pivot-table-multiple-value-fields`; that note's open question ("per-measure
> aggregation functions") is answered here.

## Desired behavior

- **Each value field carries its own aggregation function.** The authoring API lets a caller specify,
  per data/value field, which reduction to apply — at minimum **Count** in addition to **Sum**;
  ideally the full set the format allows.
- **The chosen function is serialized into the pivot definition** so the host shows the correct
  reduction and recomputes it on refresh, rather than silently defaulting everything to Sum.
- **Counting works on non-numeric fields.** Count applies to text fields (where Sum is meaningless),
  and the two counting variants are distinguished (see below).
- **Sum remains the default** when no metric is specified, matching the format default and preserving
  existing single-measure behaviour.

## Prior art (OOXML)

Each value field in the pivot table definition (`pivotTableDefinition/dataFields/dataField`) carries a
`subtotal` attribute whose enumerated values name the aggregation function:

`sum`, `count` (counts all non-empty values, including text), `average`, `max`, `min`, `product`,
`countNums` (counts only numeric cells), `stdDev`, `stdDevp`, `var`, `varp`.

The default when the attribute is omitted is `sum`. The two counting variants matter: **`count`**
counts every non-empty cell (works on text fields), **`countNums`** counts only numeric cells. The
base pivot-cache field type may also constrain what a host will meaningfully compute for a given
metric.

## Open questions

- API shape for expressing the metric per field: a string enum on each configured value field vs. a
  structured object; how to handle an unknown/invalid metric name (reject at author time vs. pass
  through).
- Whether to validate that Count-family metrics are compatible with the underlying field data, or
  leave that judgement to the host application.
- How the pivot cache is populated for count vs. sum, and whether the emitted definition needs a
  corresponding cache-field adjustment.
