# Streaming reader options: styles caching, its default, and the "dates are a style" footgun

Cluster: streaming

## Scenario

A user reads a workbook with the streaming reader and finds that date cells come back as raw serial
numbers instead of dates, or that number formats are missing. The cause is non-obvious: the streaming
reader defaults some caching options **off** for memory reasons, and — critically — a cell's date-ness
is carried by its *style* (the `numFmt`), not by the cell value. So without style caching enabled the
reader has no way to know a numeric cell is a date, and every date silently reads as a bare number.
The option name (`styles`) does not hint that turning it off also disables date interpretation, and the
published docs/types disagreed with the implementation about what the defaults even are.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: the streaming-read-with-styles behavior is already exercised elsewhere

> current-behavior assertion.

## Desired behavior

- **Option names and defaults are documented and match the implementation exactly.** The streaming
  reader's construction options (worksheet emission mode, shared-strings caching, styles caching,
  hyperlink handling, …) each have a stated default, and the types, docs, and runtime agree. A doc/type
  that disagrees with the code is itself a defect.
- **The "styles" option's effect on values is spelled out.** Because number formats live in the style
  table, style resolution governs whether date/number cells are interpreted (a serial number becoming a
  `Date`) — not merely whether visual formatting is available. The contract states this explicitly so a
  caller disabling styles knows they are opting out of typed dates, not just cosmetics.
- **The defaults are chosen to avoid the silent-wrong-data footgun.** Defaulting styles-caching off
  trades a memory saving for silently mis-typed dates — a poor default for a correctness-first library.
  The rewrite should either default to correct typed reads, or make the degraded mode loud (a typed
  result that marks such cells as "raw, unresolved" rather than handing back a plausible-but-wrong
  number), so a caller cannot get wrong data without having chosen it.
- **Memory-conscious modes remain available and explicit.** Callers who genuinely want the minimal-
  memory, values-only stream can still ask for it by name, accepting the documented consequences.

## Open questions

- The exact option surface and defaults for the rewritten streaming reader, and whether date typing is
  decoupled from full style retention (cache just the numFmt→isDate mapping cheaply, without holding the
  whole style table) so correct dates need not cost full style memory.
- Whether the degraded (styles-off) path returns raw values, marks them unresolved, or is removed
  entirely in favor of an always-correct-but-tunable-memory reader.
- How this interacts with the shared-strings caching option and the overall streaming memory budget.
