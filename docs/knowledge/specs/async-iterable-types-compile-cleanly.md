# getting cannot find name AsyncGenerator while build

## Async-iterable reader types must compile against a declared minimum

### Desired behavior
The library's published type declarations must type-check cleanly in a fresh consumer project that meets the library's *documented* minimum TypeScript version and `lib`/`target` settings — without the consumer being forced to enable `skipLibCheck`, hand-edit shipped `.d.ts` files, or add ad-hoc `lib` entries beyond what the library documents as required.

Streaming readers (workbook/worksheet/row readers) are exposed as async iterables. Their declared return types must not silently assume the consumer has enabled `esnext.asynciterable` (or an equally new `lib`) unless that requirement is:
1. Declared as a hard minimum in the package's supported-environment docs, and
2. Verified by a type-level test in CI so the assumption cannot regress.

### Prior art / evidence
Consumers on older TypeScript or with `lib: ["es2017", "dom"]` hit `TS2304: Cannot find name 'AsyncGenerator'` from the shipped `.d.ts`. Community fixes were all consumer-side band-aids: `skipLibCheck: true`, commenting out the offending declaration lines, or upgrading TS/`@types/node`/lib target. That is a symptom of the published types depending on consumer lib flags rather than being self-contained.

### Design stance for ts-xlsx
- Pick and document a firm minimum TypeScript version and required `lib` for consumers.
- Add a type-level (tsd / `expectTypeOf`-style) fixture that compiles the public `.d.ts` under exactly that documented minimum config (no `skipLibCheck`), so a regression is caught in CI.
- Prefer that async-iteration types resolve from the library's own declared `lib` requirement rather than leaking an undeclared newer-lib dependency onto consumers.

### Open questions
- What is the committed minimum TypeScript version and `lib`/`target` for consumers of ts-xlsx?
- Should the async-iterator surface be typed via `AsyncIterableIterator`/`AsyncGenerator` (needs async-iterable lib) or a narrower hand-rolled interface to reduce the lib requirement?
