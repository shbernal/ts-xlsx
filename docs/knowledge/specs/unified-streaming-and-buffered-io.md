# Streaming and buffered I/O should be one implementation, not two

Cluster: streaming

## Scenario

The library grew two largely-separate code paths for reading and writing `.xlsx`: a buffered,
whole-document-in-memory path and a streaming, forward-only path. They diverged, since the streaming
side implements a strict subset of the buffered side's features, and the two even reach for different
zip libraries. The result is a maintenance and correctness tax: a feature or fix landed on one path
silently misses the other, tests must be written twice, and callers cannot rely on the two paths
producing equivalent documents from equivalent inputs.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: this is an architecture and parity decision for the rewrite, not a
> single reproducible defect. Its durable value is the invariant it sets, which future corpus cases,
> per-feature parity assertions, will enforce.

## Desired behavior

- **One document model, one serializer, two execution strategies.** The OOXML read and write logic
  lives in a single implementation, and "streaming" against "buffered" is a strategy over the *same*
  code, meaning how much is held in memory and when bytes are flushed, not a parallel
  reimplementation.
- **Feature parity is a correctness invariant.** Any capability available buffered is available
  streaming unless it is *fundamentally* incompatible with forward-only writing, such as inserting a
  row above the write frontier. Such exceptions are explicit, few, and expressed in the type surface
  (see `streaming-writer-worksheet-type-fidelity`) rather than accidental gaps.
- **A single, modern zip layer serves both** and works in Node and the browser, removing the original
  reason the two paths diverged. The zip path is bounded and hostile-input-safe on both strategies,
  with no zip-bomb naïveté and streaming decompression with limits.
- **Tests are written once against the shared model** and parameterized over the strategy, so a fix
  cannot land on one path and miss the other.

## Open questions

- The boundary between "held in memory" and "flushed": chunk and commit granularity, and how much
  look-behind a streaming writer buffers before it must commit, which bounds the
  insert-above-frontier question.
- Browser constraints on the streaming *reader*, where there is no incremental file handle: is
  streaming read meaningful there, or buffered-only in the browser?
- Backpressure and cancellation semantics for the streaming strategy against Web Streams and Node
  streams, which ties to `public-types-node-stream-portability`.
