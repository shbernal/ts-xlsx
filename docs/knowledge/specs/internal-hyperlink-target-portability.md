# Internal (in-workbook) hyperlinks must be portable across consumers

Cluster: xlsx-io

## Scenario

An author creates a hyperlink whose destination is another location inside the same workbook, a
cell reference like `Sheet2!A1`, or a defined name, rather than an external URL. In desktop Excel
the link navigates correctly. But when the same file is opened in Google Sheets or WPS Office the
link is dead, because those consumers do not resolve it. The cause is how the internal link is
serialized: if it is emitted like an external link, with an `r:id` relationship, instead of with an
in-workbook `location`, stricter consumers silently ignore it.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: the correct serialization is knowable, but the *observable* defect is
> cross-application navigation, a rendering behavior in third-party apps that the corpus cannot
> exercise. The durable value is the OOXML shape an internal link must take.

## Desired behavior

- An internal hyperlink, to a cell or range on a sheet or to a defined name, is written so **non-Excel
  consumers** (Google Sheets, WPS) resolve and navigate to the target, not only Microsoft Excel.
- Concretely: an internal link carries a `location` attribute holding the in-workbook reference
  (`Sheet2!A1` or a defined name) and does **not** rely on an external-mode `r:id` relationship.
  An external link keeps its `r:id` pointing at a `.rels` target with `TargetMode="External"`, and the
  two forms are serialized distinctly.
- A round-trip preserves the internal target verbatim, whether a sheet-qualified reference or a defined
  name, and the display text and tooltip survive.

## Open questions

- Does the writer infer "internal against external" from the target shape, treating a sheet-qualified
  reference or a known defined name as internal and a URL scheme as external, or from an explicit
  caller flag?
- How are internal links to a defined name distinguished from those to a raw cell reference, and are
  both emitted as `location`?
- Should an internal target that does not resolve to an existing sheet or name warn on write?
