# How rich text composes with cell alignment: alignment is cell-level, runs are character-level

Cluster: styles

## Scenario

An author builds a cell whose value is rich text (multiple runs with different fonts) and wants to
control its alignment — horizontal, vertical, wrap, indent, rotation. They reach for a per-run
alignment property and find it has no effect, and are unsure where alignment belongs when the value
is composed of several runs. The confusion is structural: alignment is a property of the *cell*, not
of any run, but the rich-text shape (an array of runs, each with its own formatting) invites the
assumption that layout can be set per run.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: this is a how-to/design question with no failing serialization to
> baseline. The durable value is pinning where each property legitimately lives, so the type surface
> and docs make the correct usage the easy path. A corpus case can lock "cell alignment survives on a
> rich-text cell" once the declarative spec's cell shape can express a `richText` value.

## Desired behavior

- **Cell alignment governs the whole composed rich-text string.** When a cell's value is rich text,
  the cell-level alignment (`horizontal`, `vertical`, `wrapText`, `indent`, `textRotation`) set on the
  cell's style applies to the entire composed string exactly as it does for a plain-string cell. Rich
  text does not disable or override cell alignment.
- **Runs carry only character-level formatting.** A rich-text run's valid properties are character
  formatting — font `name`, `size`, `color`, `bold`, `italic`, `underline`, `strike`, and
  `vertAlign` (super/subscript). These map to the OOXML run-properties element (`<rPr>`), which has no
  layout/paragraph-alignment attributes.
- **Layout-shaped properties on a run are meaningless and must not silently "work".** Horizontal /
  vertical / wrap / indent / rotation are not valid run properties. Placing one on a run should be a
  no-op at minimum, and ideally rejected by the type surface (a precise `RichTextRun` type that does
  not admit alignment fields) so a caller learns at compile time that alignment belongs on the cell —
  rather than setting it per run, seeing no effect, and assuming a bug.

## Open questions

- Type surface: make run alignment *unrepresentable* (narrow `RichTextRun` to character-format fields
  only) versus accepting-and-ignoring it? The former prevents the confusion class at compile time for
  TypeScript callers and is preferred.
- `vertAlign` overlap: a run's `vertAlign` (superscript/subscript) is a legitimate character property
  and must not be confused with cell *vertical alignment*; the naming should keep them distinct.
- Read-back: confirm a rich-text cell read from a file surfaces cell alignment on the cell and only
  character formatting on each run, with no phantom per-run alignment.
