# Streaming read-modify-write: edit a large template without materializing it in memory

Cluster: streaming

## Scenario

A developer has a large pre-built spreadsheet that serves as a template. They want to load it, make
targeted edits (replace a cell value, append rows to an existing sheet, tweak a header), and write a
new file — all **without holding the whole workbook in memory**, using the streaming reader on the
input side and the streaming writer on the output side.

Today the streaming APIs are one-directional building blocks: a streaming reader that yields rows,
and a streaming writer that accepts appended rows. Nothing connects *reading* an existing package to
*re-emitting* a modified one via streaming. The only workaround is to fall back to the fully-buffered
in-memory path (read the whole file, mutate, write the whole buffer) — which defeats the purpose and
does not scale to the very templates that motivated the request.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: there is no streaming read-modify-write path to assert against, and
> the community workaround is exactly the buffered path this capability is meant to avoid. The durable
> value is the desired capability and its design tradeoffs.

## Desired behavior

- A supported way to **stream a package in, apply edits, and stream a modified package out** with
  memory bounded by the working set (the rows/parts currently in flight), not by the file size.
- **Passthrough by default.** Parts and rows the caller does not touch are copied through
  byte-for-byte (or re-emitted losslessly) rather than fully re-serialized — so an unedited sheet
  costs streaming I/O, not a full model rebuild.
- **Targeted edits are correct.** Replacing a cell value, restyling a cell, or appending rows to an
  existing sheet produces a valid package; edits that change structure (insert/delete rows, add a
  sheet) are either supported with correct reference/shared-string fixups or rejected with a clear
  error rather than silently corrupting the file.
- **Workbook-scoped state stays consistent.** Shared strings, styles, and relationship ids referenced
  by passed-through parts remain valid even when some parts are rewritten — no dangling style index or
  shared-string id.

## Prior art / observed workarounds

- Read the entire file into the buffered workbook, mutate, write the whole buffer. Correct but
  memory-unbounded — the anti-pattern this request exists to replace.
- Manual zip surgery (edit one entry, repackage) preserves memory but is fragile: it bypasses
  shared-string/style reconciliation and breaks the moment an edit touches interned state.

## Open questions

- Granularity of the edit API: a row-transform callback over the streamed input, a
  sparse patch keyed by address, or a "reopen sheet N and append" handle?
- Which structural edits are in scope for v1 — value/style patches only, or row insert/delete with
  reference rewriting?
- Passthrough fidelity vs. normalization: copy unedited parts verbatim, or re-emit them through the
  writer (risking incidental reformatting) to guarantee a single canonical output shape?
- Interaction with the memory-release model already captured for pure streaming writes.
