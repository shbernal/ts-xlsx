# Authoring an image anchor: rotation, explicit extent, and sub-cell offset are first-class inputs

Cluster: images

## Scenario

A caller anchors an image onto a worksheet and wants to place it exactly the way an interactive
editor would: rotated to an angle, sized to an explicit extent rather than the image's intrinsic
pixel size, and nudged by a fractional offset within its anchor cell. The natural expectation is that
the add-image / anchor API accepts these as authoring inputs, so that programmatically rebuilding a
sheet — for instance duplicating a sheet by re-adding its images through the public API rather than
cloning internal model objects — reproduces the original placement faithfully.

Today the anchor authoring surface is narrower than the drawing model it serializes into. Rotation is
preserved on a raw read→write round-trip (see `image-rotation-preserved-on-roundtrip`) but cannot be
*set* through the add-image path, so a caller who assembles an image with the public API gets an
un-rotated, intrinsically-sized, cell-aligned picture even when the drawing format can express far
more. Extent (an explicit width/height for the picture, independent of the source bitmap's pixel
dimensions and DPI) and a sub-cell offset (the fine EMU offset from the anchor cell's top-left) are
likewise expressible in the OOXML drawing anchor but absent from the authoring inputs.

## Desired behavior

- **Rotation is an authoring input.** The add-image / anchor API accepts a rotation angle and emits it
  as the picture shape's `<a:xfrm rot="…">` transform (OOXML 1/60000-degree units). Setting rotation
  on write mirrors the rotation that is already preserved on read, so author→write and read→write agree.
- **Extent is specifiable independently of intrinsic size.** A caller can give an explicit picture
  extent (width/height) rather than inheriting the source bitmap's pixel size; the extent serializes in
  EMU, DPI-independent (consistent with `image-pixel-extent-converts-to-emu-independent-of-dpi`).
- **Sub-cell offset is specifiable.** The anchor accepts a fractional/EMU offset from its top-left
  anchor cell, so an image can sit partway into a cell rather than snapping to the cell corner
  (consistent with `image-anchor-fractional-offset-respects-cell-size`).
- **Re-adding is lossless.** Rebuilding a sheet by re-adding images through the public API — not by
  cloning internal objects — reproduces rotation, extent, and offset, so "duplicate this sheet"
  written in terms of the public surface does not silently flatten placement.

## Open questions

- The precise units and shape of the authoring inputs: rotation in degrees (converted internally) vs
  raw 1/60000-degree units; extent in pixels vs EMU vs a cell-relative fraction; offset in pixels vs
  EMU. The public surface should favor human-legible units and convert at the boundary.
- Whether these properties belong on the `addImage`/media definition, on the anchor passed to the
  worksheet's add-image call, or split between them (media = bytes; anchor = placement/rotation).
- How rotation composes with a two-cell (from/to) range anchor, where the bounding box — not a single
  extent — defines size; rotation of a range-anchored image rotates within that box.
