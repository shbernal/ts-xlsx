# Dynamic-array (spill) formulas must not be downgraded to legacy CSE array formulas

Cluster: formulas

## Scenario

A workbook authored in a modern spreadsheet application contains a **dynamic-array formula** in a
single cell — for example a `LET` wrapping `FILTER`:

```
=LET(results, FILTER(Sheet3!$B$2:$B$1000, VALUE(Sheet3!$A$2:$A$1000) = VALUE(INDIRECT("Sheet1!S" & Sheet2!B1))), IFERROR(results, ""))
```

In modern spreadsheet semantics this is a **plain single-cell formula** that automatically *spills*
its multiple return values into the neighbouring cells of the column. It is **not** a legacy
Ctrl+Shift+Enter (CSE) array formula and carries no surrounding braces. A user reads such a workbook,
does nothing to that cell, and writes it back out. On reopening, the formula has been wrapped in
`{ … }` and now behaves as a legacy single-cell array formula: it no longer spills, and only the
top-most value is returned. The rewrite silently downgraded a dynamic-array formula to a CSE array
formula, destroying the spill.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: the library has no first-class concept of a dynamic-array (spill)
> formula distinct from a legacy CSE array formula, so this is a **model gap** — the fix is a new
> distinction in the formula model and its serialization, not a one-line assertion against current
> behaviour. It also needs a fixture authored by a real spreadsheet application (the trigger is the
> dynamic-array metadata Excel writes), which we do not yet have. It becomes a corpus case once the
> model distinguishes the two formula kinds and a round-trip asserts the emitted formula element stays
> plain (no braces, no single-cell `t="array"`).

## Desired behavior

- **The two formula kinds are distinct in the model.** A dynamic-array (spilling) formula and a legacy
  CSE array formula are represented differently, because they serialize differently and behave
  differently in the host application. Reading a plain cell formula must not classify it as an array
  formula.
- **A dynamic-array formula round-trips as a plain cell formula.** Read → write with no edit to the
  cell must emit `<f>…</f>` with the formula text verbatim and **no** wrapping braces and **no**
  `t="array"` anchored to a single cell. The spill behaviour survives because the emitted element is
  unchanged in kind.
- **Formula text is preserved verbatim**, including `LET`/`FILTER`/`INDIRECT` and nested references —
  no re-quoting, no reference rewriting on an untouched cell.
- **A genuine CSE array formula still round-trips as an array formula** (the legacy shape is not lost
  either); the two are preserved as authored, each in its own kind.

## Open questions

- OOXML surface: modern dynamic-array formulas are plain `<f>` elements, with the spill metadata
  living in the cell-metadata / `metadata.xml` + `xlrd`/`xlda` rich-data parts rather than on the
  formula element itself. How much of that metadata must be preserved for the host to treat the
  formula as dynamic vs. legacy — is keeping the formula plain (no `t="array"`) sufficient, or must the
  cell metadata be carried through too?
- Detection on read: how is a dynamic-array formula recognised on input — purely by the absence of
  `t="array"`, or by the presence of the dynamic-array cell metadata? The reader must not manufacture
  an array wrapper that was never in the source.
- Authoring: should the public API let a caller *create* a dynamic-array formula (spilling) distinctly
  from a CSE array formula, or is preservation-on-round-trip the first milestone?
