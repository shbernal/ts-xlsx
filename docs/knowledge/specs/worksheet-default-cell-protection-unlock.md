# Worksheet-default cell protection: unlock all cells without per-cell style bloat

Cluster: styles

## Scenario

A common template pattern ships a protected worksheet: a few header rows stay locked, but every
other cell must be editable by the end user. In OOXML, cell protection (the `locked` flag) only takes
effect once the worksheet itself is protected, and every cell is `locked` by default. To invert that
today — lock a few cells, unlock the rest — the only route is to iterate over a guessed rectangle of
thousands of rows and columns setting each cell's protection to unlocked. That is both a correctness
hazard (the guessed bounds may be too small, leaving cells unexpectedly locked, or too large,
inflating the sheet) and a size hazard: writing an explicit unlocked style to thousands of cells
materializes a style record and a per-cell style reference for each, bloating the file dramatically.
The user wants either a single operation to unlock all cells, or a way to author a worksheet whose
cells are unlocked by default so only the intentionally locked cells carry deviating metadata.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: this is a missing authoring capability (express a non-default
> protection baseline efficiently), not a malformed-output bug with a current behavior to assert.
> Sheet-level protection authoring and password-hash compatibility are already covered by corpus
> cases; this note is the umbrella policy for the *default cell protection* axis and its size
> contract. It becomes a corpus case once the surface exists and a case can assert that unlocking N
> default-matching cells produces zero per-cell style deviations.

## Desired behavior

- **Worksheet-level default protection.** A caller can declare "this worksheet's cells are unlocked by
  default" (and the inverse) as a worksheet or default-style property, without touching every cell.
  Locking/unlocking specific cells, rows, or columns then expresses only the *exceptions* to that
  default.

- **The default belongs in the default cell format, not per cell.** OOXML models cell protection via
  the `<protection locked="…" hidden="…"/>` element inside a cell format (`xf`) record in `styles.xml`,
  and it only matters once `<sheetProtection>` is present. The `locked` default is `true` at the
  format level, so a workbook whose *default* cell format carries `locked="0"` yields an all-unlocked
  sheet with **zero** per-cell metadata. The library must encode a worksheet's default protection in
  that default/normal format (and the sheet's default row/column formatting), the way Excel does, so
  the common case costs nothing per cell.

- **No per-cell style explosion for default-matching cells.** Unlocking (or locking) N cells that all
  match the worksheet default must not produce N distinct per-cell style references — it must produce
  none, because those cells already inherit the default. Only cells whose protection *deviates* from
  the default carry their own style index. This is the load-bearing size contract: it is what makes a
  200k-cell "unlock everything but the header" sheet small instead of enormous.

- **Round-trip stability.** Reading a file that uses a non-default protection baseline, editing, and
  writing back must preserve the default-vs-exception structure rather than flattening it into
  explicit per-cell protection on every cell.

## Open questions

- Surface shape: a `worksheet.protection` authoring object with a `defaultLocked` (or
  `cellsLockedByDefault`) flag, versus a method like `worksheet.unlockAllCells()` that sets the
  default format? The declarative default is more honest and composes with the exceptions; a helper
  method can wrap it.
- Interaction with row- and column-level default formatting: unlocking a whole column should ride the
  column's default format, not fan out to its cells. Define which level "wins" when a cell, its row,
  its column, and the sheet default all specify protection.
- Whether `hidden` (the formula-hiding protection flag) follows the same default/exception model as
  `locked`, since they share the `<protection>` element.
- Should applying an explicit protection equal to the current default be a no-op (emit nothing) so
  round-tripping and idempotent edits don't reintroduce per-cell bloat?
