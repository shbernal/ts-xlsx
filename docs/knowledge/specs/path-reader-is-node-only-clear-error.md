# The filesystem-path reader is Node-only and must fail clearly elsewhere

Cluster: streaming

## Scenario

A developer wants to open a spreadsheet in the browser (or another non-Node runtime) and reaches for
the convenience entry point that takes a filesystem path — the most discoverable "open a file"
method. In the browser there is no filesystem: the underlying path/stat machinery is unavailable, so
the call blows up deep inside the library with an opaque internal error (an undefined-property read
on a file-existence flag) that gives no hint the real problem is "this method only works under Node."
The correct approach is to obtain the file's bytes (e.g. from a file input via an `ArrayBuffer`) and
hand them to the buffer-loading API — the environment-neutral entry point.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: the defect is a discoverability/error-quality cliff plus a design
> choice (absent-in-browser-builds vs guarded runtime error), not a malformed-output behavior. The
> durable value is the constraint and how the API should surface it.

## Desired behavior

- The path-based read entry point is understood as inherently **Node-only** (it needs filesystem
  access). Invoked without that capability it fails fast with a **clear, actionable** error that
  names the constraint and points at the fix — e.g. *"reading from a filesystem path requires a
  Node.js environment; in the browser, load the file's bytes with the buffer-loading API instead"* —
  never an internal undefined-property dereference.
- The **buffer/array-buffer loading path is the documented, primary way to open a file** so users
  do not default to the path reader. Correct use is the easy path. (An analogous buffer loader
  exists for CSV.)

## Open questions

- Should the path reader be **entirely absent from browser builds** (tree-shaken / not exported), so
  the mistake is a compile-time type error rather than a runtime crash? For a TypeScript-first
  library this is the cleanest outcome — the type surface exposes filesystem readers only under Node.
- If it remains present at runtime, what is the canonical guard — feature-detect the fs capability
  up front and throw a named error type?
- Documentation: ensure the buffer-loading entry point is prominently the primary "open a file"
  method.
