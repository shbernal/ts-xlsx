# A number format declared on a column must reach that column's cells

Cluster: styles

## Scenario

An author declares columns up front and gives a column a number format (e.g. a percentage `0.00%`)
as part of its style, then appends rows whose values fall into that column. The expectation is that
each written cell inherits the column's number format so the value renders formatted (0.12 shown as
"12.00%"). The report was framed as streaming-specific — streamed cells written with default/general
formatting, ignoring the column-level numFmt — but probing shows the column-declared numFmt fails to
reach the data cells in **both** the streaming and the buffered writers when the column is declared
via the columns array and rows are added by key. So the durable requirement is broader than
streaming: a column's declared number format must reach its cells regardless of write path.

> records the distinct, currently-unmet requirement that a *column-level* numFmt propagate to cells,

## Desired behavior

- A `numFmt` declared on a column applies to the data cells in that column: a value placed in the
  column is written with a style referencing that number format, so it renders formatted rather than
  as General.
- Behavior is **identical between the streaming and buffered writers** for the same column/numFmt
  declaration — neither silently drops it.
- The column-level format composes predictably with a per-cell numFmt: an explicit cell numFmt wins;
  otherwise the column's applies.

## Open questions

- Propagation model: does a column style materialize onto each written cell's style record at write
  time, or is it stored once as a column style the reader resolves per cell? (Affects file size and
  the styles table.)
- Does declaring the column via the columns array behave the same as `getColumn(n).numFmt = …`? Today
  they may differ; the fork should make one predictable path.
- Interaction with the header row (which should not inherit a data-oriented numFmt like a percentage).
