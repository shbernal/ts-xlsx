# Preserve VBA on round-trip of macro-enabled workbooks (.xlsm)

Cluster: formats

## Scenario

A user maintains a macro-enabled spreadsheet (.xlsm) with VBA automation — for example a report
template whose embedded macro exports to PDF. They want to open it, edit worksheet data
programmatically, and save it back with the macros intact so it still runs when reopened in Excel.
Today, reading and rewriting such a workbook silently strips the VBA project, yielding a plain .xlsx
that has lost its macros. (The related, explicitly out-of-scope wish is to *invoke* macros from
Node; that needs a live Excel/automation host and is not a document-tool concern.)

> Spec note, not a corpus case: capturing this needs a real .xlsm fixture and a feature that does not
> yet exist, so there is no assertable behavior to lock today. The durable value is the preservation
> contract and its packaging details.

## Desired behavior

- On reading an .xlsm, the library **retains the VBA project part** (`vbaProject.bin`) and its
  associated relationships and content-type declarations for **byte-faithful round-trip** — the
  preserved bytes stay the sole thing the writer emits.
- On writing, if the source carried a VBA project (or the caller explicitly requests macro-enabled
  output), the package is emitted with the correct macro-enabled content type and the
  `vbaProject.bin` part **re-embedded byte-for-byte** — so a round-trip that only edits cell values
  yields a file Excel still treats as macro-enabled with functioning macros.
- Callers can **read** the macro source through a lazy, read-only typed view
  (`Workbook.vbaProject`), derived from the preserved bytes without a write-back path — see
  ADR 0016. Reading never perturbs what the writer emits.
- Callers can **attach, replace, copy, or remove** a macro project at the bytes level through
  `Workbook.vbaProjectBytes` (a get/set accessor pair over the raw `vbaProject.bin`) — see ADR 0017.
  Setting bytes makes the written package macro-enabled and embeds them verbatim (validated fail-closed:
  a malformed blob is rejected, never half-applied); setting `undefined` demotes the workbook to a plain
  package. Replacing or removing drops a now-stale signature over the old bytes.
- Callers can **author or edit a macro project's module source** — but this needs genuinely compiled,
  source-matched p-code that **only a real Excel can produce**, so it is done by the offline
  `tools/vba-compiler` build tool (VBIDE), not in the shipped library — see ADR 0019. It emits either a
  `vbaProject.bin` (attach via `Workbook.vbaProjectBytes`) or a whole edited `.xlsm` (in-place, for
  document/designer code-behind). **The earlier pure-TS "author/edit from source" surface
  (`writeVbaProject`/`setVbaProject`, `editVbaModuleSources`/`setVbaModuleSource`/`editXlsxVbaModuleSource`,
  `addVbaModule`) has been removed:** it emitted modules with no/zeroed p-code and reset `_VBA_PROJECT` to
  an "unmatchable version cookie" on the theory that Excel recompiles from source on open. Excel does
  **not** — a module runs the compiled p-code it ships — so those files either threw "Invalid data format"
  or silently ran stale code (ADR 0019 retracts ADRs 0017 §2.3c and 0018). The prior "Verified against
  real Excel" claims never exercised the compile/load step (macros were force-disabled, or Enable Content
  was never clicked).
- Callers can still apply **pure-TS structural edits** that never touch a module's p-code: `removeVbaModule`
  and `addVbaReference`, with `Workbook.removeVbaModule`/`addVbaReference` (model level) and
  `editXlsxVbaRemoveModule`/`editXlsxVbaAddReference` (package level, swapping only `xl/vbaProject.bin` and
  leaving every other part byte-for-byte). These splice the original `.bin`, editing only the `dir` stream
  (and, for a removal, `PROJECT`/`PROJECTwm`) and leaving every module stream and `_VBA_PROJECT`
  untouched — the `dir` stream is authoritative for the module/reference list. Verified with
  `execute-verdict.ps1` (opens with macros enabled, runs a surviving macro).
- A signed VBA project's `vbaProjectSignature` part is preserved alongside — it is a sibling part
  reached from `xl/_rels/vbaProject.bin.rels`, so the closure walk carries it through, and its
  distinct `.bin` content type is re-declared per-part (not collapsed into the `vbaProject` default,
  which a single extension `<Default>` would otherwise do — locked by `preserved-parts.test.ts`).
  Editing the *project itself* legitimately invalidates the signature; editing unrelated cells does
  not (see open questions). Every project-mutating surface drops the now-stale signature.
- **Out of scope:** executing/running macros (needs a live host — ADR 0013), and authoring/editing module
  *source* inside the shipped library (needs real compiled p-code; done by the offline `tools/vba-compiler`
  instead — ADR 0019). In scope in pure TS: attaching/replacing a whole `.bin`
  (`Workbook.vbaProjectBytes`), and structural edits that don't touch p-code — remove a module, add a
  reference (ADRs 0018/0019). The library is a document tool, not a VBA interpreter.

## Prior art

OOXML defines a distinct macro-enabled content type for the workbook part and packages the VBA as a
binary `vbaProject.bin` referenced by a workbook relationship; the ZIP container is otherwise
identical to .xlsx. Many OOXML libraries treat the VBA project as an opaque blob they copy through
without parsing. Macro-enabled templates (.xltm) are the template analog.

## Open questions

- API surface: automatic preservation whenever a VBA part is detected on read, or gated behind an
  explicit flag when writing?
- Output-format choice (.xlsx vs .xlsm): infer from source, from filename extension, or an explicit
  option?
- ~~Expose the VBA project bytes to callers, or only pass them through opaquely?~~ **Decided
  (ADR 0016):** exposed as a lazy, read-only typed view (`Workbook.vbaProject`), derived from the
  preserved bytes with no write-back path.
- ~~Let callers author macros, or only preserve what a read produced?~~ **Decided (ADRs 0017–0019):**
  authoring is supported, but **source authoring/editing needs a real Excel** (only it emits runnable
  p-code), so it lives in the offline `tools/vba-compiler` — the pure-TS from-source surface tried in ADRs
  0017/0018 was retracted (ADR 0019) because Excel does not recompile from source on open. In the shipped
  library: attach-blob (`Workbook.vbaProjectBytes`) and pure-TS structural edits (`removeVbaModule`,
  `addVbaReference` + their wrappers) are shipped, each fail-closed.
- **Signature on a project edit is dropped**: editing the project invalidates any signature over
  it, so every project-mutating surface discards the stale `vbaProjectSignature` (part, relationship,
  content-type override) rather than leave it advertising a broken signature. Editing unrelated cells still preserves
  it (the part round-trips correctly typed). ~~An `isSigned` accessor is still sourceable from the preserved
  closure once a consumer needs it.~~ **Built (ADR 0021):** `Workbook.vbaProjectSigned` (boolean) and
  `Workbook.vbaProjectSignatures` (raw bytes + generation) read the presence of a signature over the
  preserved closure — a **read** with no cryptographic verification, so the drop behavior above is now
  observable in-memory (a replaced project reads unsigned). Detection keys off the relationship Type's
  final segment, so all three generations (legacy 2006, agile 2014, V3 2020) are recognised regardless
  of the year the URI carries; the closure walk already preserves each part. CMS/PKCS#7 parsing, cert-
  chain validation, and signer identity stay out of scope.
- ~~Parse macro/toolbar-referenced `customUI`, or leave it opaque?~~ **Audited & fixed:** the ribbon
  parts (`customUI/customUI.xml`, `customUI14.xml`) hang off the *package root* `_rels/.rels`, not the
  workbook rels, so the workbook-closure net never reached them and the writer — which regenerates the
  root rels from the model — dropped them. Now captured as package-root preserved references and
  re-declared verbatim on write (locked by `preserved-parts.test.ts`). **A typed read view now sits on
  top** (ADR 0020): `Workbook.customUI` parses the `<ribbon>` subtree (tabs → groups → controls +
  callback names) of each part, lazily and memoised, keying dialect off the `<customUI>` namespace. It
  is strictly additive — preservation stays the sole emission authority, so the bytes still round-trip
  opaquely; the reader just projects a view over them, exactly as `Workbook.vbaProject` does. Backstage
  / QAT / contextualTabs / commands and ribbon *authoring* stay deferred (no consumer). Fixing this
  surfaced a latent wrong fact: the round-trip fixture had used the customUI14 *namespace* as its
  relationship *type* — corrected to the real `.../office/2007/relationships/ui/extensibility`.
