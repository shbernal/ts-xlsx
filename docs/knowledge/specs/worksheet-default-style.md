# A worksheet-level (and workbook-level) default style, mapped to OOXML defaulting

Cluster: styles

## Scenario

A user building a worksheet with many columns wants to set a base look — font, fill, alignment,
number format, border — **once**, at the worksheet (or workbook) level, rather than applying the same
style object to every column or cell. Today a uniform look across a large sheet means either looping
over all columns/cells to assign the identical style or reaching for OOXML's default column/row
formatting, which the API does not expose ergonomically. A default-style facility would let authors
declare "unless overridden, cells in this sheet use this style" and then specify only the deviations.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: this is a missing authoring surface, not a current-behavior bug. It is
> the umbrella over two facet-specific notes already recorded — a default *font*
> (`default-font-workbook-worksheet-level`) and default *cell protection*
> (`worksheet-default-cell-protection-unlock`) — generalizing the same defaulting mechanism to the
> whole style surface. It becomes corpus-covered once the surface exists and a case can assert a
> default-styled sheet renders correctly with no per-cell style stamping.

## Desired behavior

- **Declare a default style once.** Expose a way to set a default style (font, fill, alignment,
  numFmt, border) scoped to a worksheet, applied as the base for every cell/column/row that does not
  specify its own. Cell- and column-level styles override the worksheet default; the worksheet default
  overrides any workbook-wide default. This subsumes the existing default-font ask and the
  default-protection ask as facets of one mechanism.

- **Map to OOXML defaulting, do not materialize per cell.** The format already models this: the
  `cellXfs` index 0 plus the "Normal" cell style is the document-wide default; `<sheetFormatPr>`
  carries default row height and base column width; `<cols>` `<col>` spans carry a default style and
  width. A well-designed API surfaces (a) a workbook-level default feeding the Normal style / default
  `cellXf`, and (b) a worksheet-level default mapping to `<col>` default spans and `<sheetFormatPr>`.
  So the feature is largely a mapping onto existing defaulting rules — **not** stamping the same style
  id onto every cell. Writing a default-styled sheet must stay O(deviations), not O(cells): a
  worksheet whose default is a custom font must not emit a per-cell style reference for every cell that
  merely inherits it. (Shares the size contract of `worksheet-default-cell-protection-unlock`.)

- **Round-trip stability.** Reading a file that uses a non-default base style surfaces it through the
  same API used to set it, so read-modify-write preserves the default rather than flattening it into
  explicit per-cell styles.

## Open questions

- Granularity: worksheet-level only, or also a workbook-level default? (The request is phrased at
  worksheet level, but the underlying Normal-style default is workbook-wide — likely both, with
  worksheet overriding workbook.)
- Which facets are defaultable at each level — is a default *border* or *fill* meaningful at the
  `<col>`/`<sheetFormatPr>` level, or only font/numFmt/alignment, with fill/border requiring a real
  per-column style span?
- Precedence order when workbook default, worksheet default, column style, row style, and cell style
  all touch the same facet — define and lock the resolution chain.
- How this composes with value-based style dedup (`style-dedup-value-based-and-cell-add-style`): the
  default is the base that per-cell deviations are diffed against.
