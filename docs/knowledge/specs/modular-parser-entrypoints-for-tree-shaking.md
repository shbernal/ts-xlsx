# Format loaders behind tree-shakeable entry points

Cluster: streaming

## Scenario

A browser or performance-sensitive application uses only a subset of the library's parsing
capabilities: it reads and writes only CSV, or only XLSX, or only manipulates an in-memory workbook
without touching any file format. Today all format loaders are pulled in transitively when the
workbook entry point is imported, so even a CSV-only consumer ships the entire XLSX/OOXML parsing
stack in their minified bundle. The consumer wants to pay in bundle size only for the formats they
actually use.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: this is a package-architecture and bundle-size concern, not an
> assertable spreadsheet behavior. It cannot be expressed through the roundtrip or inspect adapter,
> and if verified at all it is via a build-time import-graph or bundle-size test, outside the
> behavior corpus. Concrete KB figures are non-durable motivation, not a contract.

## Desired behavior

- **The document model is format-agnostic.** The in-memory workbook and worksheet model, the "core",
  does not reference any serialization format. Building and mutating a workbook in memory pulls in no
  format parser at all.
- **Each format sits behind its own tree-shakeable entry point.** CSV, XLSX/OOXML, and any future
  formats live behind dedicated subpath exports, or per-format read and write functions, rather than a
  single mutating-accessor facade that eagerly references every format. A standard bundler can drop
  the XLSX stack entirely from a CSV-only application, and vice versa.
- **The package declares itself side-effect-free** (`"sideEffects": false`) so bundlers can eliminate
  unused branches, and the durable requirement is *"unused format code is eliminable by a standard
  bundler,"* verified by an import-graph or bundle test rather than a fixed KB number.

## Prior art / root cause

The reference implementation bundled all parsing behind a single workbook facade, with
`workbook.csv.load` and `workbook.xlsx.load` style accessors, coupling every format into one import
graph so a CSV-only or core-only consumer could not shed the XLSX weight. For a TypeScript-first ESM
rewrite this is naturally addressed by a format-agnostic core module, per-format read and write
functions or subpath exports instead of mutating-accessor facades, and `sideEffects: false`.

## Open questions

- Ergonomics against tree-shakeability: keep a convenience umbrella export covering all formats
  alongside the granular subpath exports, accepting that the umbrella defeats tree-shaking, or force
  explicit per-format imports as the only path?
- Static subpath exports, which are simpler, SSR-safe and bundler-driven, or lazy `dynamic import()`
  code-splitting, which wins more in the browser but is async and more complex?
- Where does the streaming reader and writer live relative to the core-against-format split, since
  streaming is XLSX-specific?
- What is the durable verification: an import-graph assertion that the CSV entry point does not
  reach the XLSX modules, rather than a brittle absolute size budget?
