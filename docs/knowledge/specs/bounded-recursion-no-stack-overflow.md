# Serialization must be iterative, not deeply recursive — no stack-overflow on large data

Cluster: security/deps

## Scenario

A user builds a worksheet from a large JSON dataset and calls `writeBuffer()`. On a development
machine the export succeeds; on another environment (a production bundle, a smaller default stack, a
different engine) the same export dies with `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`. The
failure is data-size-dependent and environment-dependent: the write walks the model (or an XML/render
tree) with a recursion depth that scales with the number of rows/cells/nodes, so past some threshold
the call stack is exhausted. The document is not malformed and the data is not adversarial — it is
simply big enough, on a stack small enough, to overflow.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: reproducing this reliably requires driving the model to whatever depth
> overflows the *current* stack, which is engine- and build-dependent and would either not trigger in
> CI or risk crashing the runner. The durable requirement is the invariant, verified by design review
> and a bounded large-input smoke test, not by a data file that must overflow to assert.

## Desired behavior

- **Serialization depth is bounded by document structure, not by data volume.** Emitting N rows or N
  cells must not consume O(N) stack frames. Row/cell/token emission is iterative (a loop or an
  explicit work-stack), so a million-row sheet writes at constant stack depth. Recursion, where used,
  is bounded by the genuine nesting depth of the format (a handful of levels), never by row count.
- **The same guarantee holds on the read path.** Parsing a large or deeply-repetitive part must not
  recurse per element; a hostile file cannot force unbounded recursion (this is the stack-exhaustion
  sibling of the memory-bound and zip-bomb guards — a crafted file must fail cleanly, not blow the
  stack).
- **Large exports are streaming-friendly.** The streaming writer already emits row-by-row; the
  buffered writer must share the same non-recursive emission core so both paths inherit the bound.
- **Failure, if a real limit is hit, is a typed, catchable error** with context (which part, how far),
  never an opaque `RangeError` from the engine's call stack.

## Open questions

- Where legacy actually recurses per-element (the XML render/stringify tree is the prime suspect) and
  whether the modern rewrite's serializer is iterative by construction or needs an explicit guard.
- What a meaningful large-input smoke test looks like (row count high enough to have overflowed legacy
  on a typical stack) without making CI slow or flaky.
- Whether to expose a configurable soft cap on document size that fails fast with guidance ("use the
  streaming writer") before the engine's hard limit is reached.
