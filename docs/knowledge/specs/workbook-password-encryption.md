# Whole-file password encryption of workbook documents

Cluster: security

## Scenario

A user producing spreadsheets with sensitive data wants the generated file itself to require a
password to open: true document-level encryption, not a zip password and not sheet or workbook
structure protection. The distinction matters, because sheet protection and zip passwords are
trivially stripped or extracted to disk unencrypted, whereas an Excel-encrypted file keeps its
contents encrypted at rest and demands the password before any data is readable. They also want the
inverse: reading and decrypting such a file back into the library.

> Spec note, not a corpus case: this is a substantial unbuilt cryptographic feature. The durable
> value is the format facts (CFB and MS-OFFCRYPTO), the API shape, and the hostile-input constraints,
> distinct from the much lighter sheet and workbook *protection* flags (see
> `sheet-protection-permits-requested-operations`).

## Desired behavior

- Produce, and ideally consume, **password-encrypted spreadsheet documents at the whole-file level**,
  distinct from OOXML protection flags, which are removable, and any zip-level password.
- **Format facts**: Excel encryption does not encrypt inside the zip. The entire OOXML zip package is
  placed as an encrypted stream inside a **CFB / OLE2 (Compound File Binary)** container per
  ECMA-376 and MS-OFFCRYPTO. Two schemes exist: "Standard" (AES plus SHA-1 key derivation, fixed
  structure) and the newer "Agile" (an `EncryptionInfo` XML descriptor selecting cipher, hash, salt
  and spin count, with AES-CBC and HMAC integrity). Writing: build the normal `.xlsx` zip, derive the
  key from the password, encrypt the package, and emit a CFB container with `EncryptionInfo` and
  `EncryptedPackage` streams. Reading: detect the CFB magic, parse `EncryptionInfo`, derive the key,
  verify the password against the verifier, decrypt back to the zip, and parse normally.
- **API shape** (durable, to refine): an encryption descriptor on the write path accepting a password,
  and optionally scheme and cipher, defaulting to Agile plus modern AES, and symmetrically a password
  option on read or load that decrypts before parsing and surfaces a **typed error** distinguishing
  wrong password from malformed container.
- **Hostile-input bounded**: this is a hard-input-facing parser path, so cap spin counts, bound
  allocations, and use vetted crypto primitives.

## Open questions

- Ship both Standard and Agile for writing, or only Agile for writing while tolerating both on read?
- Where does CFB/OLE2 container support live: a small internal module or a dependency, given
  supply-chain hygiene goals?
- Gate the crypto weight behind an opt-in entry point so it is not pulled into every bundle?
- Interaction with streaming writers, since encryption needs the full package before sealing.
- Keep the API naming clearly separate from sheet and workbook protection flags.
