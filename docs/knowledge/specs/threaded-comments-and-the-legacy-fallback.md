# Modern threaded comments, and why we own their legacy fallback

Cluster: comments

## Scenario

A reviewer leaves a modern threaded comment in Excel — a conversation with an author identity, a
timestamp, replies, an optional resolved state, and possibly an `@mention`. This is not the same
feature as a legacy note (`cell.note`); the two coexist in real files, on different cells of the same
sheet. Round-tripping such a file must keep the conversation, and callers must be able to read it as
structure and author a new one.

The trap that made this urgent: Excel writes a **legacy fallback `<comment>`** beside every thread,
carrying the `[Threaded comment]\n\nYour version of Excel allows you to read this…` boilerplate with
a copy of the messages, authored by a synthetic `tc={headId}` entry. Read naïvely, that boilerplate
becomes `cell.note` — so a load/save produced a garbage note *and* lost the conversation.

## Wire format (verified against Excel-authored bytes, not inferred)

An MS-XLSX extension, not base ECMA-376. Both parts' roots share the namespace
`http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/spreadsheetml/2018/threadedcomments` (plural
`threadedcomments`).

- **Per sheet** — `xl/threadedComments/threadedComment{n}.xml`, root `<ThreadedComments>`:
  ```xml
  <threadedComment ref="A1" dT="2026-07-24T10:56:41.72" personId="{GUID}" id="{GUID}" done="1">
    <text>the message body</text>
    <mentions><mention mentionpersonId="{GUID}" mentionId="{GUID}" startIndex="0" length="13"/></mentions>
  </threadedComment>
  ```
  A reply carries `parentId` = the head's `id` and follows its head in document order. `done="1"`
  sits on the **head only** and is absent (not `done="0"`) when the thread is open, so a message's
  resolved-ness is a property of its thread. `dT` is **local wall-clock with fractional seconds and
  no zone or `Z`** — not a round-trippable instant, which is why we carry it as a verbatim string
  rather than a `Date`.
- **Per workbook** — `xl/persons/person.xml`, **singular and unnumbered**, root `<personList>`:
  ```xml
  <person displayName="Jane Doe" id="{GUID}" userId="S::jane@example.com::{tenant}" providerId="AD"/>
  ```
- **Relationship types** (the *only* wiring — no worksheet element names these parts, the way none
  names a pivot table): `…/office/2017/10/relationships/threadedComment` from the sheet and
  `…/office/2017/10/relationships/person` from the workbook.
- **Content types**, both `+xml` overrides: `application/vnd.ms-excel.threadedcomments+xml` and
  `application/vnd.ms-excel.person+xml`.

Facts that are easy to get subtly wrong, each established by a probe:

- **Every one of the six id attributes is pinned to a brace-wrapped, UPPER-CASE hex GUID** —
  `person/@id`, a message's `id`/`personId`/`parentId`, and a mention's `mentionpersonId`/`mentionId`.
  Both halves bite: a bare GUID is rejected and so is a lower-case one, so **`crypto.randomUUID()`
  output is invalid as written** — the one obvious way to make an id in JS. The authoring path
  therefore *normalises* (braces added, upper-cased) rather than merely validating; the reader never
  rewrites an id, because every reference points at it. See `commentThreadGuid`.
- **Note the lowercase `p` in `mentionpersonId`.** `mentionPersonId` is rejected as undeclared — a
  useful negative control, since it proves the validator really inspects this part rather than
  skipping it as unknown.
- **All four mention attributes are required** (each dropped in turn → `Sch_MissRequiredAttribute`).
  `startIndex` is a 0-based character offset into the message text and `length` **includes the
  leading `@`** (`@Grace Hopper` = 13) — settled by *rendering*, the only oracle that could: Excel
  draws the chip over exactly that span.
- **`startIndex`/`length` are `xsd:unsignedInt`** — `4294967295` validates, `4294967296` fails as
  "not a valid 'UInt32' value".
- **A mentioned identity gets its own `<person>` entry with `providerId="PeoplePicker"`**, distinct
  from the same human's `providerId="AD"` authoring entry: same `displayName` and `userId`, different
  `id`. So `providerId` is not always `"AD"`, the registry legitimately holds several entries per
  human, and **the registry must be keyed by person `id` alone** — interning by name or `userId`
  merges these two and silently breaks the mention on write.
- **Excel's own `<personList>` order is not stable** (its save re-sorts by person id), so nothing may
  depend on entry order.
- **Thread part numbers follow the sheet index and a gap is fine.** A workbook whose first sheet has
  only notes writes `threadedComment2.xml` with no `threadedComment1.xml`; nothing addresses these
  parts by number.
- **Three things Excel writes that are unnecessary**, all omitted by our output with every thread,
  reply, resolved flag and mention still read back: `xmlns:x` on both part roots (declared, never
  used), `shapeId="0"` on a fallback `<comment>`, and an `xr:uid` on a *genuine* note (its own
  revision id — revision metadata, and `mc:Ignorable`).
- **Excel writes the fallback text with CRLF; we write LF.** XML 1.0 §2.11 line-end normalisation
  makes these identical to every reader, so the corpus compares after normalising — do not "fix" the
  writer to emit CR.
- **Mentions cannot be authored locally at all.** Excel's `@` picker never appears for a workbook on
  a local disk; it needs OneDrive/SharePoint so it can resolve and notify people. Ground truth came
  from *inject a schema-correct shape → let Excel re-canonicalize it*, so the committed fixture is
  Excel's own output rather than a reconstruction.

## The load-bearing finding: `tc=` + `xr:uid` bind a cell to its thread

The single most consequential fact, and the reason this feature is not "preserve the parts and move
on". Preserving `threadedComment{n}.xml`, `person.xml`, both relationships and both content-type
overrides yields a package that **validates clean and in which Excel reads back zero threaded
comments and three ordinary notes.** Cause: re-serialising `comments{n}.xml` from the note model
collapses `<authors>` to one empty `<author/>` and drops each `<comment>`'s `xr:uid`, and Excel
matches a cell to its thread through exactly those two. The thread part is intact and orphaned.

The converse holds too, and is worse: a `tc=`-authored `<comment>` with its `xr:uid` but **no** thread
part opens clean, validates clean, and reports `CommentsThreaded.Count = 0` *and* `Comments.Count = 0`
— the text is shown as neither a thread nor a note. It simply disappears.

So **the fallback comment and the thread part are two halves of one representation and must be
emitted together or not at all.** In `write.ts` both halves derive from a single `threads` variable,
which makes the invariant structural rather than a rule someone has to remember.

## Behavior as shipped

**Read.** `parsePersons`/`parseThreadedComments` (`src/io/xlsx/threaded-comments.ts`) stay faithful to
document order; `buildCommentThreads` groups messages into threads, resolves authors and mentions
against the workbook registry, and canonicalises each thread's `ref`. Persons load before the sheet
loop, since the sheets resolve through the registry.

**The model** (`src/core/comment-thread.ts`, on the public barrel): `Person`, `Comment`,
`CommentThread`, `Mention`. Two shape decisions worth not re-litigating:

- **There is no `cell.commentThread`.** A `Cell` has no back-reference to its sheet, let alone to the
  workbook the persons live on, and a thread is not cell *content* the way a note is — putting it in
  `CellModel` would advertise authoring the writer ignores. It is a sheet-level read view instead
  (`commentThreads`, `commentThreadAt(ref)`), mirroring `loadedPivotTables`. `commentThreadAt`
  canonicalises the ref **without** going through `getCell`, which would materialise a cell and
  change written output on a read-only query.
- **Both the resolved object and the raw id are carried** (`Comment.author` + `personId`,
  `Mention.person` + `personId`), so an id the registry does not hold stays diagnosable instead of
  reading as blank. `mentionId` is carried for the same reason: the writer cannot invent one.

**Write** — `threadedCommentsXml`/`personsXml`, exact inverses of the parsers, carrying **no clock and
no id generator**: every guid and timestamp comes from the model, so one workbook always serialises
byte-identically. Attribute order matches Excel's. The registry is emitted only when some sheet emits
a thread part — with no conversation, nothing can reference a `<person>`.

**Authoring** — `Worksheet.addCommentThread` and `Workbook.addPerson`. These had to land with the
writer: once emission came from the model, `restoreCommentThreads` was the only way in, i.e. a
reader's name on the write path. Authoring is "pass a fully-formed conversation", so an **injected
id/clock factory turned out to be unnecessary** for determinism — the serialiser cannot reach a clock
even in principle. A generator would be pure convenience.

**The fallback is owned, not tolerated** (the D4/D5 rationale):

- On read, a `tc={guid}` author marks its comment as a fallback, and it is dropped **only when we hold
  the thread it names** — keyed on the thread *id*, not on the cell having been threaded. A file whose
  thread part is missing or unreachable therefore *keeps* the boilerplate as `cell.note`, because it is
  then the last remaining record of what was said.
- On write it is rebuilt from the thread model with its `tc={headId}` author, its `xr:uid`, and Excel's
  own author layout (thread authors first, then the shared anonymous note author). `Reply:` **repeats
  per reply** (`Comment:\n    <head>\nReply:\n    <r1>\nReply:\n    <r2>`), every body indented four
  spaces, one `<comment>` per thread rather than per message.
- `<authors>` indices are consequently load-bearing: a self-closing `<author/>` must be given an
  explicit close tag or every later index shifts and an ordinary note inherits a `tc=` author — at
  which point suppression deletes it. The `xmlns:mc`/`mc:Ignorable="xr"`/`xmlns:xr` declarations are
  emitted only when a fallback exists, so a note-only part stays byte-unchanged.
- **A note and a thread cannot share a cell.** Excel refuses both orders (`AddComment` on a threaded
  cell and `AddCommentThreaded` on a noted cell each fail with `0x800A03EC`), so coexistence is *per
  sheet, not per cell*. Only a foreign generator or a hand-edit produces that shape: tolerate it, do
  not model it.

## Hostile input: the exposure runs toward the writer

"Bound the new parser paths" had no allocation left to guard — the package's inflate ceiling bounds
the bytes, and the SAX layer bounds the shapes (one non-recursive O(n) pass; entities decoded but
never expanded, so billion-laughs is structurally impossible rather than mitigated). The real exposure
was the other direction: **what the reader accepts, the writer re-emits.** A mention offset from a
foreign part flows straight into our output, and `String(1e21)` is `"1e+21"` — a numeric literal no
schema accepts — so one hostile offset makes *our* file invalid and invites Excel to repair the whole
conversation away.

Bounded at the schema's UInt32 ceiling in three places by design (`MENTION_OFFSET_MAX`,
`commentThreadOffset`): the parser drops such a mention while keeping the message text, the authoring
verb throws, and `mentionsXml` refuses it regardless — so the serialiser *cannot* emit an
out-of-range span however the model was populated. Generalisable: on a feature that round-trips, "is
this input safe to hold?" is the wrong question — ask **"is this input safe to write back?"**

Two more deliberate asymmetries:

- **A message id is only meaningful within its sheet.** A reply names its head inside the sheet's own
  thread part, and the fallback binds its cell by the same id inside the sheet's own comments part;
  nothing resolves across a part boundary. So a **cross-sheet** id collision is harmless and is *not*
  rejected, while a **within-sheet** one is (two heads sharing an id would make a reply join the wrong
  thread on re-read and hand two fallbacks one `tc=` author and one `xr:uid`).
- **An unreachable part is tolerated; a malformed one is not.** A sheet rel with `Target=""` yields no
  threads, keeps the boilerplate as a note, and re-writes neither the thread part nor an orphaned `tc=`
  author — and notably does **not** adopt the part by filename, since guessing is how a conversation
  gets attached to the wrong sheet. A *truncated* part instead throws out of the whole read, like any
  corrupt part: a broken package is a hard error, never a silently halved conversation.
- Tolerated without ceremony: an orphan `personId` (the id stays on the model, unresolved), a dangling
  `parentId` (the message opens its own thread rather than being lost), a thread on an empty cell (a
  comment anchors regardless of the cell's value), and a duplicated `<person>` (parsed as written;
  precedence belongs to the workbook registry).

## Deliberately not modeled

A genuine note's own `xr:uid` and `shapeId` (revision metadata Excel does not need back from us);
notification/mention delivery, which is a service concern, not a document one; and any per-message
`resolved` flag — resolution is a thread property because only the head carries `done`.

Related: `reading-comments-with-vml-drawing-must-terminate`, `comment-explicit-size`,
`worksheet-comment-rel-empty-target-tolerated` (the legacy-note sibling of the tolerance case).
No ADR: ADR-0014 §3 already frames picking up a preserved-only part family as a normal feature slice
rather than a decision needing its own record.
