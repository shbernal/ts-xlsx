# Carrying image-bearing content between workbooks must copy the media or fail loudly

Cluster: images

> **Resolved (2026-08-25).** `Workbook.exportImages(sheet)` / `Workbook.importImages(sheet, images)`

## Scenario

A user copies content — a worksheet, a range, a drawing — from one workbook into another, and the
copied images render as broken in the destination file. The cause is structural: an image in OOXML is
a two-part thing — a drawing/anchor in the worksheet that references an image by a workbook-scoped
media id, plus the actual media bytes and the relationship that binds them. Copying only the
drawing/anchor (or the cell model) into a different workbook carries a reference to an image id that
does not exist there, so the writer emits a package with a dangling drawing relationship pointing at
media that was never registered — a silently broken image.

## Desired behavior

- **Copying image-bearing content transparently copies the media.** When a drawing/anchor (or a
  worksheet/range containing one) is copied into a different workbook, the underlying image media
  bytes and their relationships are registered in the destination workbook and the anchor is rebound
  to the destination's media id — so the image renders, not breaks.
- **Or fail loudly, never silently.** If the library cannot or does not copy the media (e.g. a
  low-level model copy that only moves the anchor), an anchor referencing a media id absent from the
  destination workbook must produce a clear, actionable error at write time — naming the missing image
  — rather than emitting a package with a dangling drawing relationship that a consumer shows as a
  broken image.
- **Round-trip integrity of the destination package.** After a cross-workbook copy, every drawing
  relationship in the written package resolves to a real media part with a unique rel id (the same
  packageParts/rel-id invariant the table/comment coexistence cases assert), and re-reading the
  destination surfaces the image anchored where it was placed.
- **A raw `model` splice cannot carry the media, and no longer fails opaquely when it doesn't.** As
  originally reported, transplanting an image-bearing worksheet's serialized `model` into a
  *different* workbook (`dstWorkbook.addWorksheet(...).model = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(srcSheet.model))`,
  the workaround users reached for absent a copy API) threw `TypeError: Cannot read properties of
  undefined (reading 'name')` at **write time**, because the anchor referenced a workbook-scoped media
  id that did not exist in the destination. That is now an `AuthoringError` naming the image id, and
  the model no longer carries anchors at all (ADR-0005) — so the splice is a content-only copy by
  construction, and `importImages` is how the pictures follow.

## Open questions

None. The affordance, the de-duplication policy and the scope are all settled in the resolution
note above. In-cell rich-value images remain unmodelled, but that is
`image-embedded-in-cell-vs-floating-anchor`'s question rather than this one's.
