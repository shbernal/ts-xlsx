# Conditional Formatting

<!-- Generated from the public types by `pnpm run docs`. Do not edit by hand. -->

### `CfTimePeriod`

<sub>type</sub>

The window a `timePeriod` rule matches against, relative to the day the sheet is recalculated.

```ts
type CfTimePeriod =
  | 'today'
  | 'yesterday'
  | 'tomorrow'
  | 'last7Days'
  | 'thisMonth'
  | 'lastMonth'
  | 'nextMonth'
  | 'thisWeek'
  | 'lastWeek'
  | 'nextWeek';
```

---

### `CfValueObject`

<sub>interface</sub>

One anchor of a colour-scale, data-bar, or icon-set scale: a "conditional format value object".
`type` names how `value` is read: a literal `num`, a `percent`/`percentile` of the range, a
`formula`, or the range's own `min`/`max` (which carry no value).

```ts
interface CfValueObject {
  type: CfValueObjectType;
  value?: number | string;
}
```

---

### `CfValueObjectType`

<sub>type</sub>

How a [`CfValueObject`](./conditional-formatting.md#cfvalueobject) reads its `value`: `ST_CfvoType` verbatim.

```ts
type CfValueObjectType = 'num' | 'percent' | 'max' | 'min' | 'percentile' | 'formula';
```

---

### `ConditionalFormatting`

<sub>interface</sub>

A set of rules bound to the range(s) they cover. `ref` is an OOXML `sqref`: one or more
space-separated areas (`"A1:C1 A3:C3 A5:C5"`), the shape Excel writes when one rule is applied to
several non-contiguous selections at once.

```ts
interface ConditionalFormatting {
  ref: string;
  rules: ConditionalFormattingRule[];
}
```

---

### `ConditionalFormattingOperator`

<sub>type</sub>

How a `cellIs` or text rule compares, as `ST_ConditionalFormattingOperator` enumerates it.

Overlaps `import ('./data-validation.ts').DataValidationOperator` in four members and diverges
in the rest: this one has the text comparisons a validation has no use for, and spells "does not
contain" as `notContains` where nothing else in the format does.

```ts
type ConditionalFormattingOperator =
  | 'lessThan'
  | 'lessThanOrEqual'
  | 'equal'
  | 'notEqual'
  | 'greaterThanOrEqual'
  | 'greaterThan'
  | 'between'
  | 'notBetween'
  | 'containsText'
  | 'notContains'
  | 'beginsWith'
  | 'endsWith';
```

---

### `ConditionalFormattingRule`

<sub>interface</sub>

A single conditional-formatting rule. `type` is the OOXML cfRule type; the remaining fields carry
the operands that type needs and are absent otherwise. A rule the library does not model in depth
still preserves `type`, `priority`, `operator`, `formulae`, and `dxfId` across a round-trip.

```ts
interface ConditionalFormattingRule {
  type: ConditionalFormattingType;
  /** Evaluation precedence; lower wins. Excel requires one, so the writer supplies it when absent. */
  priority?: number;
  /** Halt evaluation of lower-priority rules on any cell this rule matches. */
  stopIfTrue?: boolean;
  /** cellIs / text comparison operator (`greaterThan`, `between`, `beginsWith`, …). */
  operator?: ConditionalFormattingOperator;
  /** Formula operands: cellIs bounds, an expression predicate, a containsText target formula, … */
  formulae?: (string | number)[];
  /** The literal a containsText / beginsWith / endsWith rule searches for. */
  text?: string;
  /** A differential style authored inline, serialised into `<dxfs>` and referenced by the cfRule. */
  style?: DifferentialStyle;
  /** A differential-style reference by `<dxfs>` index, as read from a file (kept verbatim). */
  dxfId?: string;
  /** colorScale / dataBar / iconSet scale anchors, in order. */
  cfvo?: CfValueObject[];
  /** A dataBar's bar colour. */
  color?: Color;
  /** A colorScale's colours, one per {@link cfvo}. */
  colors?: Color[];
  /** A dataBar's gradient-fill flag. Lives only in the x14 extension, not the classic element. */
  gradient?: boolean;
  /** A dataBar's fill colour for negative values. An x14 extension property. */
  negativeFillColor?: Color;
  /** A dataBar's axis colour (the zero line between positive and negative bars). An x14 property. */
  axisColor?: Color;
  /** An iconSet's named icon family (e.g. `3TrafficLights1`). */
  iconSet?: IconSetType;
  /** top10 rank cutoff. */
  rank?: number;
  /** top10: the rank is a percentage rather than a count. */
  percent?: boolean;
  /** top10: rank from the bottom rather than the top. */
  bottom?: boolean;
  /** aboveAverage: match above (default) or below the average. */
  aboveAverage?: boolean;
  /** aboveAverage: include cells equal to the average. */
  equalAverage?: boolean;
  /** aboveAverage: match beyond this many standard deviations. */
  stdDev?: number;
  /** timePeriod window (`today`, `lastWeek`, …). */
  timePeriod?: CfTimePeriod;
}
```

### `ConditionalFormattingType`

<sub>type</sub>

What a rule tests, as `<cfRule type>` carries it: `ST_CfType` verbatim.

Closed, and stated in full rather than left as `string`, even though the library models only some
of these in depth. Depth of modelling and legality are different questions: a `timePeriod` rule
whose operands the library never inspects still round-trips, while a token outside this list is one
Excel refuses to open, so it is refused on the way in and on the way out alike.

```ts
type ConditionalFormattingType =
  | 'expression'
  | 'cellIs'
  | 'colorScale'
  | 'dataBar'
  | 'iconSet'
  | 'top10'
  | 'uniqueValues'
  | 'duplicateValues'
  | 'containsText'
  | 'notContainsText'
  | 'beginsWith'
  | 'endsWith'
  | 'containsBlanks'
  | 'notContainsBlanks'
  | 'containsErrors'
  | 'notContainsErrors'
  | 'timePeriod'
  | 'aboveAverage';
```

---

### `IconSetType`

<sub>type</sub>

The named icon family an `iconSet` rule draws from, as `ST_IconSetType` enumerates it. The leading
digit is the number of icons, which is also how many [`CfValueObject`](./conditional-formatting.md#cfvalueobject) anchors the rule needs.

The 2009 extension adds three more families (`3Stars`, `3Triangles`, `5Boxes`) under its own
namespace. They are absent here because the classic `<iconSet>` element this list types cannot
carry them; a file using one states it in the extension, which the library round-trips verbatim.

```ts
type IconSetType =
  | '3Arrows'
  | '3ArrowsGray'
  | '3Flags'
  | '3TrafficLights1'
  | '3TrafficLights2'
  | '3Signs'
  | '3Symbols'
  | '3Symbols2'
  | '4Arrows'
  | '4ArrowsGray'
  | '4RedToBlack'
  | '4Rating'
  | '4TrafficLights'
  | '5Arrows'
  | '5ArrowsGray'
  | '5Rating'
  | '5Quarters';
```
