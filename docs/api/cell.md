**Members**

- `readonly row: number;` — 1-based row index.
- `readonly col: number;` — 1-based column index.
- `get address(): string;` — Canonical A1 address of this cell (`"B3"`).
- `get value(): CellValue;` — The cell's value; `null` when empty. Assigning `undefined` clears it.
- `get type(): ValueType;` — The observable `ValueType` of the current value.
- `get fill(): Fill | undefined;` — The cell's background fill, or `undefined` when it has none. Each cell owns its own fill; assigning one never aliases a neighbour's style, so a fill set on one cell cannot bleed onto its row, column, or sheet siblings.
- `get numFmt(): string | undefined;` — The cell's number-format code (`"0.00%"`, a custom accounting format, …), or `undefined` for the General format. Stored verbatim: the invariant form Excel persists — `.` decimal, `,` grouping, `/` date separator — is neither localized nor rewritten, so the code round-trips character-for-character. Like `fill`, each cell owns its own code; a cell that also carries a column-level format keeps both, so overriding one facet never drops the other.
- `get font(): Partial<Font> | undefined;` — The cell's font — bold/italic/underline, size, colour, typeface — as a partial set of the facets that differ from the default (only the facets actually set are carried, exactly as OOXML stores them). `undefined` means the cell uses the workbook default font. Like `fill` and `numFmt`, each cell owns its own font object, so a font set on one cell never aliases or bleeds onto its row, column, or sheet siblings.
- `get border(): Border | undefined;` — The cell's border — the line style and colour of each side — or `undefined` when the cell has none. An absent edge within a border means that side is unbordered, so reading a cell never fabricates a border it does not have. Like `fill`, `numFmt`, and `font`, each cell owns its own border object, so a border set on one cell never aliases or bleeds onto its row, column, or sheet siblings.
- `get alignment(): Alignment | undefined;` — The cell's alignment — how its content sits within the cell, plus the wrap/shrink flags — or `undefined` when it uses the defaults. The boolean flags are off unless explicitly set, so a cell that never enabled wrapping never reads back wrapped. Like `fill`, `numFmt`, `font`, and `border`, each cell owns its own alignment object, so an alignment set on one cell never aliases or bleeds onto its row, column, or sheet siblings.
- `get protection(): Protection | undefined;` — The cell's protection — its locked/hidden flags, enforced only once the sheet is protected — or `undefined` when the cell carries neither. `locked` defaults to on in OOXML, so a cell that never touched protection is implicitly locked and reads back as `undefined`, not as `{locked: true}`; the flag only becomes explicit when a cell is unlocked. Like `fill`, `numFmt`, `font`, `border`, and `alignment`, each cell owns its own protection object, so protection set on one cell never aliases or bleeds onto its siblings.
- `get quotePrefix(): boolean | undefined;` — The quote-prefix flag: when set, a spreadsheet stores the cell's content as literal text even when it looks like a formula or number, and shows a leading apostrophe in the formula bar without that apostrophe being part of the stored value. `undefined` (or `false`) when unset. It is a cell-format flag — an attribute on the cell's `xf` record — so it composes independently of the value and, like the other style facets, never bleeds onto sibling cells.
- `get namedStyleId(): number | undefined;` — The index of the `Workbook.namedStyles named cell style` this cell links to (its OOXML `xfId`), or `undefined` when the cell references no named style beyond the default. The cell inherits any facet its own direct format leaves unset from that named style; the reader resolves the effective look onto the cell's own facets, and this link is preserved so a round-trip keeps the cell tied to its named style rather than flattening it away.
- `get note(): string | undefined;` — The cell's note (comment) as plain text, or `undefined` when it carries none. A note is metadata anchored to the cell, independent of its value: a cell can hold a note while empty, and clearing the value leaves the note intact. Like the style facets, each cell owns its own note, so a note set on one cell never bleeds onto its siblings, and a structural edit that shifts the cell carries the note along to its new position.
