# Decision records

One file per decision, kept because the *reasoning* is the part that rots invisibly: a
config line can be re-read, but the four options we rejected and why cannot be recovered
from the tree. An agent reaching a fork already covered here should find the answer
instead of re-deriving it — and, more importantly, should find out when the answer was
**withdrawn**.

That last part is why this index exists. Five of these records no longer say what they
appear to say, and until now the only way to learn that was to open the file. A retracted
ADR read as live guidance is worse than no ADR at all: ADR 0018's mechanism (splice a
module's source into `vbaProject.bin`) was verified, documented, confidently written, and
does not work.

**Status is the column to read first.** Retracted records are kept, not deleted — the
disproof is the valuable part — but they are guidance about history, never about what to
do now.

**The acceptance date orders these, not the number.** ADR 0029 was renumbered out of a
collision and sits last while dating from 2026-07-19; renumbering the twenty-seven records
after it would have broken far more cross-references than the collision did.

## Writing one

Take the next free number. State the decision in the title as a claim, not a topic — "Async
is one writer, not a mirrored pair" tells a reader what changed; "Async I/O" does not. Give
the status line a date and, when the record depends on or alters another, say which and how.
Then add the row here, because an index nobody updates is how a retracted record gets read
as live guidance.

When a decision turns out to be wrong, **retract it in place**: mark the status, name the
record that retracts it, keep the body, and say in one line what specifically failed. Do not
delete it and do not quietly edit the body into being correct — the disproof is why the file
is worth keeping, and a body edited to match hindsight destroys exactly the evidence that
would stop the next agent trying the same thing.
