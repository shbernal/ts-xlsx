# ADR 0023 — Seven subpath entry points, disjoint by construction, with the error taxonomy as its own face

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-29) · packaging · extends ADR 0006 (docs generated from the barrel),
which assumed a single entry point.

## Context

`package.json` published exactly one specifier, `"."`, and `src/index.ts` re-exported 200 symbols
through it. A consumer writing a plain `.xlsx` therefore had the CFB reader, the MS-OVBA codec, the
ribbon parser, the BIFF12 decoder and CSV in the same module graph, and `"sideEffects": false` was
**not** declared — so a bundler had to assume every module was impure and keep all of it.
`scripts/size-budget.ts` measured one number for the whole `dist/`, which cannot see per-feature
cost and cannot notice a layer being crossed.

Measuring the static-import closure of each candidate entry against the emitted JS changed what the
step was worth doing *for*. The naive expectation — that splitting the barrel makes each codec
cheap — is mostly false here, and the measurements say why:

| entry | closure | note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| everything | 863 KB | |
| `/xlsx` | 848 KB | `readXlsx` sniffs and dispatches a binary package to the BIFF12 reader |
| `/xlsb` | 435 KB | |
| `/csv` | 308 KB | `readCsv` builds a `Workbook`, so it pulls the model whole |
| `/core` | 299 KB | of which ~150 KB is VBA + ribbon: `Workbook` models a macro project |
| `/vba` | 73 KB | |
| `/customui` | 26 KB | |
| `/errors` | 12 KB | |

Two structural facts fell out of that table and are worth more than the split itself: the model
drags the whole VBA codec because `Workbook` parses and edits `vbaProject.bin` directly, and the
XML codec drags the whole BIFF12 codec because auto-detection is part of `readXlsx`'s contract
(architecture.md, "Two serialisations, one model") and the API is synchronous, so the dispatch
cannot be a dynamic import.

## Decision

1. **Seven entry barrels under `src/entries/`, one per published subpath** — `/core`, `/xlsx`,
   `/xlsb`, `/csv`, `/vba`, `/customui`, `/errors` — with `src/index.ts` unioning them so the bare
   package name still carries everything. The entries are *not* the existing internal barrels:
   `src/vba/index.ts` and `src/customui/index.ts` carry the CFB writer, the MS-OVBA primitives and
   the part-path constants that the model and the codecs need, and those are implementation. A
   public face has to be able to be narrower than the module it fronts.

2. **Each symbol is listed in exactly one entry, and `src/index.ts` is `export *` over all seven.**
   The alternative — an explicit curated list at the root *and* in each entry — means every new
   export needs two edits and a forgotten one is silent. The union costs nothing and cannot drift.

   The disjointness this requires is load-bearing, not tidiness: `export *` does not report an
   ambiguous re-export, it **drops the name**. A symbol exported from two entries would disappear
   from the root specifier with no diagnostic from `tsc`, from lint, or from any test that imports
   it by a subpath. `scripts/check-entries.ts` (a gate in `verify --full`) fails the build on a
   duplicate, on an entry `package.json` does not publish, on a published subpath whose module is
   gone, and on an entry the root barrel forgot to union.

3. **Every error class is exported from `/errors` and from nowhere else.** This follows from (2)
   rather than being an independent taste: a container-level failure belongs to no single codec —
   `readXlsx` and `readXlsb` both raise `UnsupportedFormatError`, and `XmlParseError` escapes any
   codec that parses a part — so shelving the classes with their codecs would have forced exactly
   the duplication the union cannot survive. Giving the taxonomy its own face turns that constraint
   into the best entry in the table: the classes reach nothing but each other, so a service that
   only classifies a failure (log it, map it to a status, decide whether to retry) pays 12 KB and
   not a parser. It also answers "what can this throw at me?" with one import.

4. **No `/streaming` subpath**, though the working plan proposed one. Measured, `read-rows` plus
   `write-stream` reach every module `read` plus `write` do, plus three. An entry point that costs
   what the codec costs is an alias, not a packaging boundary; `readSheetRows`,
   `readWorkbookStream` and `WorkbookStreamWriter` are exported from `/xlsx`, where they belong.

5. **`"sideEffects": false`**, verified rather than asserted: no module under `src/` touches
   `globalThis`, a prototype, or `process` at import time, and every top-level statement in the
   emitted JS is a declaration. `scripts/check-layering.ts` was extended to see the bare
   `import '…'` form as well as `… from '…'`, so a side-effect-only import cannot enter unnoticed
   now that the manifest promises there are none.

6. **Budgets are per entry, and the total was raised from 600 KB to 950 KB** (**amended 2026-08-08**:
   every figure in this point was roughly halved — total 530 KB — when `build` split into two `tsc`
   passes and the JS pass began stripping comments. Nothing left any closure; the numbers here had
   been ~47% comment prose, so they were measuring the wrong thing. Rebaselined onto comment-free
   emit they measure code, which is what makes the tripwire below able to do its job at all.) 600 KB had been the
   number since before the BIFF12 reader, the VBA codec and the ribbon parser landed; the build was
   measured at 861 KB and CI's `pnpm run size` step had been failing on it, unread. None of that
   growth was bloat, and a tripwire nobody can satisfy stops being read at all. The signal moves to
   the per-entry closures, which notice what a total cannot: a codec acquiring a *value* import of
   something it previously needed only as a type moves one entry's number and leaves the total
   exactly where it was.

7. **`scripts/smoke-dist.ts` imports through the package name, not `../dist/`.** Node's
   self-reference resolves a package's own `exports` map, and that is the only thing in the repo
   that exercises it — the corpus's `dist` target loads emitted modules by file path, so a subpath
   resolving to nothing would pass every other gate and fail on a consumer's first install. The
   smoke test also asserts the two shape invariants the budgets state only as numbers: `/core`
   reaches nothing under `dist/io/`, and `/errors` reaches nothing but error modules.

## Consequences

- **Additive; nothing breaks.** The root specifier exports the same 200 symbols it did before —
  proved by `docs:check`, which regenerates the API reference from the root barrel and showed a
  zero diff across the rewrite.
- **A consumer with a bundler should keep importing the bare name.** With `sideEffects: false` the
  bundler prunes better than a subpath can, because it works per symbol rather than per module. The
  subpaths are for the case where the graph itself should state the dependency: no bundler, or an
  architectural boundary worth making visible.
- **`/xlsx` being ~98% of the package is now a published fact rather than a surprise.** The README
  table says so, with the reason. Making it smaller means making `readXlsx`'s auto-detection
  lazy, which the synchronous API forbids — a real decision, not a tidy-up, and not this one.
- **`/core` carrying the VBA codec is the next honest target.** ~150 KB of the model's 299 KB is
  VBA and ribbon parsing, because `Workbook` owns `parseVbaProject`/`addVbaReference`/
  `removeVbaModule` directly. Moving that behind a seam the model does not import at value level
  would halve the model's cost, and would be a breaking change to `Workbook`. It is deliberately
  out of scope here: this ADR is about how the package is published, not about what the model owns.
- **Revisit when:** an async read path exists (a dynamic import could then make the BIFF12 codec
  optional on the `/xlsx` path), or a consumer needs a subpath finer than a codec.
