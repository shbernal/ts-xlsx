# ADR 0027 — Dependencies are updated by a bot, and CI is the reviewer

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-30) · maintenance slice, after the 1.0.2 release path settled

## Context

A large part of why this fork exists is that upstream's dependency tree rotted in place:
not because anyone decided to keep old packages, but because nobody decided anything for
two years and the default of a dependency is to age. This repository is three months old
and already carries a runtime dependency, five devDependencies that *are* the quality
gates, a .NET oracle, a pinned package manager, and four workflows' worth of GitHub
Actions. Nothing about being young protects it from the same failure.

The obvious counter — "we'll update them when we touch them" — is precisely the policy
upstream had. It fails silently, and the moment it has failed is not observable.

The complication is that this project is deliberately human-minimal. A bot that opens
fifteen pull requests a month solves the rot and replaces it with a review queue nobody
drains, which is the same problem wearing a hat. So the question is not whether to
automate the updates; it is **who reviews them**, given that the answer cannot usually be
"a person".

## Decision

**Renovate runs on this repository, and the gate set is the reviewer.** Configuration is
`.github/renovate.json5` — JSON5 so the reasoning lives next to the setting it explains.

1. **An update that survives the gates is merged without a human.** `verify --full`, the
   regression corpus on both `src/` and the emitted artifact, the size budget and the OOXML
   oracle all run on every pull request. That is the same evidence a human reviewer of a
   version bump would ask for and the only evidence they could actually check. This applies
   to **non-major devDependencies**, **GitHub Actions minor/patch/digest**, and **weekly
   lockfile maintenance**.

2. **Four classes stop and wait**, because CI cannot judge them:
   - **`dependencies`** — the runtime tree is what consumers install. A green corpus proves
     it works here, not that the version range we publish is one we meant to publish.
   - **Every major**, by Renovate's default. A major is a claim that something changed
     enough to break, and the gates confirming it did not is an argument, not a decision.
   - **The .NET validator and SDK.** A green run after bumping the oracle proves less than
     one after bumping the library, because the thing that changed is the judge.
   - **The Node floor** — `engines`, `.nvmrc` and `@types/node` majors — held at
     *dependency-dashboard approval* rather than opened as a PR. The supported floor is set
     by ADR-0001 and is stated in three places at once; a bot may raise the subject, not the
     floor, and never in one place out of three.

3. **A three-day cooldown applies to everything**, waived for vulnerability fixes. The
   window in which a compromised or yanked release is caught is the first days after it is
   published; automerge without a cooldown lands one within minutes of it existing. The
   asymmetry is deliberate — a known CVE is a worse risk than a bad release.

4. **GitHub Actions are pinned to commit digests** (`helpers:pinGitHubActionDigests`), and
   the digests are then automerged. An action tag is mutable code running with the
   workflow's identity, and in `publish.yml` that identity is one npm will exchange for a
   token that can publish this package (ADR-0026). Pinning is only sustainable because the
   same bot keeps the pins current: pinned-and-stale is worse than unpinned.

5. **Alerts come from OSV directly** (`osvVulnerabilityAlerts`), not from GitHub's
   Dependabot alerts, which are a repository setting — invisible in a diff and silently
   switchable, the same objection ADR-0026 raised against click-ops environments.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** the tree stays current by default rather than by remembering; the failure
  mode of an update is a red check on a pull request instead of a discovery two years
  later; the actions that run with publish rights are immutable references; and the
  decisions that are genuinely ours — the runtime floor, what consumers install, what the
  oracle is — are the short list a human actually reads.
- **Negative / deferred:** automerge makes the gate set load-bearing in a new way. A gap in
  coverage that a human reviewer might have caught by reading a changelog now merges
  silently, so the honest reading of this ADR is that it raises the cost of a weak test
  rather than lowering the cost of a dependency. It also grants a bot write access to
  `master`; the blast radius is bounded by ADR-0026 — publishing needs a tag, an
  environment and a human approval, none of which Renovate can supply.
- **Watch for:** NuGet lockfile updates. `tools/ooxml-validator` restores in locked mode, so
  a `.csproj` bump whose `packages.lock.json` was not regenerated fails the build. That
  failure is loud and lands on a PR nobody has merged, which is the acceptable version of
  this going wrong; if it recurs, the rule is to disable the `nuget` manager rather than to
  relax locked mode.
- **Revisit when:** the automerged set produces a regression that reached `master`, or the
  review queue for the stop-and-wait classes stops being drained — either one means the line
  is drawn in the wrong place.
