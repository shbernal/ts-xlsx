# ADR 0024 — Async is one writer, not a mirrored pair

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-29) · I/O surface

## Context

`readXlsx`/`writeXlsx` are synchronous and the README sells that as a differentiator. But
`zipSync` on a large workbook blocks the event loop for seconds, which is a real problem for a
server generating a workbook per request, and `WorkbookStreamWriter.commit()` is already `async` —
so the obvious move was a symmetric `readXlsxAsync`/`writeXlsxAsync` pair over `fflate`'s
worker-backed API, keeping the sync functions as the default.

Measuring first changed the shape of the answer. Deflating a ~42 MB part map with `fflate`'s
callback `zip()` against `zipSync`, one process per case, `monitorEventLoopDelay` for the stall:

| workbook shape | `zipSync` | `zip()` async | event-loop stall under async |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| one large sheet | 1408 ms | 1417 ms | max **17 ms** |
| twenty sheets | 1402 ms | **581 ms** | max 41 ms |

Under `zipSync` the loop does not tick at all for the whole duration. So the async writer buys
responsiveness always, and wall-clock only when there are several parts to deflate in parallel —
one sheet means one worker means the same total time.

The read side does not mirror this, for two independent reasons.

**The compression is not the cost.** `readXlsx` inflates and then runs the SAX parse and model
build synchronously. Moving inflation to a worker leaves the majority of the work on the caller's
thread, so a `readXlsxAsync` would advertise a non-blocking read and then block for most of its
duration. That is a promise the library would not keep — the same reasoning that deleted
`UnsupportedFeatureError` before it shipped in the error-taxonomy work.

**It would regress the zip-bomb ceiling.** `io/opc/inflate.ts` derives its guarantee from feeding
compressed input in 16 KiB slices and checking a running *output* counter between them, which bounds
worst-case overshoot to one slice's expansion (~16 MiB at DEFLATE's ~1032:1 ceiling). With
`AsyncUnzipInflate` the counter sits on the calling thread while a worker keeps producing, and
`fflate` exposes no way to enforce a cap inside the worker. The cap would become advisory with
unbounded lag, on the reader's primary hostile-input surface.

One premise behind the symmetric pair also turned out to be wrong. `commit()` being `async` is not
evidence that the synchronous contract is already inconsistent: it awaits a Node `Writable` —
backpressure and finish — which is I/O, not CPU offload. Streaming to a sink is inherently
asynchronous; deflating a buffer is not.

## Decision

1. **Synchronous stays the default and the documented shape.** `readXlsx`, `writeXlsx`, `readCsv`,
   `writeCsv` and the `.xlsb` reader are unchanged.

2. **Add `writeXlsxAsync`, and nothing else.** It shares `buildPackageParts` with `writeXlsx` and
   differs only in handing the part map to `fflate`'s worker-backed `zip()`. Every part compresses
   to identical bytes; the two archives differ only in the per-entry timestamp.

3. **No `readXlsxAsync`**, for the two reasons above. Callers who need a non-blocking read run the
   whole read in a worker, which is a documentation answer.

4. **The asymmetry is stated, not hidden.** `writeXlsxAsync`'s doc comment says why there is no
   read counterpart, because a reader who notices the gap will otherwise assume it is an oversight.

5. **Failures propagate exactly as the sync path's do.** `AuthoringError` from part-building arrives
   as a rejection rather than a throw; a zip-layer failure — including an environment that cannot
   spawn a worker — propagates unwrapped, as it already does from `writeXlsx`. Wrapping it in
   `InternalError` would have been false: that class documents "no caller can provoke one", and a
   worker-hostile environment is provocable.

## Consequences

- The published surface gains one function and one asymmetry. A symmetric pair would have read
  better in the API reference and been worse in fact.
- The event-loop win is available to the buffered writer without touching the streaming writer,
  which already solves a different problem (bounded memory, not thread occupancy).
- Reading a large workbook still blocks. That is now a stated limitation with a stated workaround
  rather than an unexamined default.
- If a non-blocking read is ever wanted in-library, the path is a worker returning a
  structured-cloneable model, not an async inflater. There is a per-sheet `WorksheetModel` today
  but no workbook-level equivalent, so that is a feature, not a packaging change.

## Alternatives rejected

- **A symmetric `readXlsxAsync`/`writeXlsxAsync` pair.** The original plan. Rejected on the two
  read-side findings above: it would under-deliver on its central promise and weaken the zip-bomb
  bound to buy it.
- **Async-first, demoting sync.** Rests on the premise that the sync story was already broken by
  `commit()`, which conflates I/O-async with CPU-offload-async. It would also make the common
  small-workbook case worse for no gain.
- **Sync-only, workers as the whole answer.** Defensible, but it leaves a measured multi-second
  stall on the table for a five-line function over a seam that was already clean.
- **Pinning `mtime` so the two writers are byte-identical.** Tempting while testing, but it changes
  `writeXlsx`'s output and belongs to a separate question — whether `.xlsx` output should be
  reproducible at all, which it is not today for the same reason.
