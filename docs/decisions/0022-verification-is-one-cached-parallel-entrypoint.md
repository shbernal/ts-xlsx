# ADR 0022 — Verification is one cached, parallel entrypoint

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-27) · implements the dispatch table of [ADR 0010](./0010-agent-correctness-dispatch.md) over the toolchain of [ADR 0029](./0029-toolchain-standup.md)

## Context

The gate set is cheap per gate and expensive per session. Nothing named "the gates" —
agents assembled the chain by hand each time, spelled it differently each time, and
sometimes dropped `docs:check` or `constitution:check` from it; the turn-boundary hook
then re-ran a subset of the same work seconds later. Measured over one long session,
verification took roughly half of all shell wall time to produce fewer than a dozen
genuine checkpoints.

The fix is not weaker gates. It is one name for the gate set, run concurrently, and
never re-run against a tree already proven green.

## Decision

### One entrypoint, two depths

`scripts/verify.ts` owns the gate set. `--full` **is** the definition — `pnpm test`,
lefthook's `pre-push`, CI's `corpus.yml`, and the Stop hook are all that same command, so
they cannot disagree. `--quick` (types, unit tests, lint scoped to changed files) is the
inner loop and is explicitly **not** a substitute: it has no corpus. The granular
`package.json` scripts stay as the way to run *one* gate by hand; nothing automated
composes them into a set.

CI enumerated the gates as one step each for a single real benefit — a failing gate naming
itself in the Checks UI rather than hiding in the log — and paid for it with a second
definition that nothing kept in step. Workflow commands buy the annotation without the
copy: under `GITHUB_ACTIONS`, verify emits `::error title=verify: <gate>::` per failure
with the diagnostics in a collapsed `::group::`. The enumeration is gone.

Gates are spawned from `node_modules/.bin` directly. `pnpm run <script>` costs ~1 s of
pure wrapper per invocation, which is why the docs tell agents to call `node
scripts/verify.ts` rather than `pnpm run verify`.

### Concurrency is bounded at two, and that is not core starvation

The gates are not single-core jobs: `node --test` forks a process per test file and
Biome saturates every core. Running all of them at once inflated each gate about 2× and
produced a *worse* wall than two at a time. Measured on a 14-core box: jobs=1 29.8 s,
jobs=2 20.7 s, jobs=3 19.6 s, jobs=7 19.2 s (±25 % run to run) — everything past two is
inside the noise. Two `tsc` runs racing cost 1.87 s against 1.57 s alone, so the
contention is filesystem and scheduler, not CPU count. `--jobs` overrides for anyone who
wants to re-measure on different hardware; do not replace the constant with a
core-count heuristic without doing so.

The two typecheck configs are **one gate with two sequential steps**, not two gates:
they both re-read all of `src/` and were the worst-contending pair.

### Incremental typecheck, but not `composite`

Both configs set `incremental` with buildinfo under `node_modules/.cache/` (halves a warm
`tsc`). `composite` + `references` — which would let the harness project consume src's
declarations instead of re-elaborating them — **is not available here**: a referenced
project may not disable emit (`TS6310`), and these configs exist to gate a tree that is
never built ([ADR 0001](./0001-rewrite-runtime-and-toolchain.md)). Do not revisit without
also giving up the build-free dev path.

Two traps this laid, both now pinned by comments at the site:

- `tsconfig.build.json` extends the gate config and so inherited `incremental`. Buildinfo
  lives outside `dist/`, so after `clean` tsc concluded the unchanged sources needed no
  emit — and said nothing: **158 files, then 0 files, exit 0 both times.** It pins
  `incremental: false`.
- A diagnostic *replayed* from buildinfo exits `1`; a fresh elaboration exits `2`.
  Everything here tests for non-zero. Anything that keys on `2` would break.

### Lint fails on warnings, or most of the rule set is enforced by nothing

Biome exits `0` when every diagnostic is a warning, and most of its `style` group — including
`noNonNullAssertion` — is a warning by default. The gate was therefore green on a tree carrying
18 of them, against CLAUDE.md §2's "No warnings". Every gate that runs Biome passes
`--error-on-warnings`, so severity is a presentation choice and never an enforcement one.

### Lint is scoped by explicit file list, and needs no confirming pass

`--quick` passes Biome the changed files (`git diff`, `--cached`, untracked), filtered to
the lint roots: ~0.5 s against ~6.5 s whole-tree, falling back to the whole tree past 100
files. **`biome check --changed --since` is not the way** — measured at 5.3 s, the git
walk eats the saving. And `biome check --write` still exits non-zero when a diagnostic
survives, so a green `lint:fix` is already the proof and the confirming `lint` run is
waste.

### A cache hit is a proof, not a skip

`--cached` records a stamp under `.tmp/` keyed by the HEAD sha, the full `git diff HEAD
--binary`, and the path and content of every untracked file. Same key means the gates
would be handed the same bytes, so their verdict is already known — this is why the Stop
hook can be fast without becoming advisory.

The key is content-derived with **no path allow-list**: an unrelated edit costs one extra
run, which is the safe direction to be wrong in. A failing run records nothing, so a
regression cannot be cached green.

The hook runs `--full --cached`, not `--quick`. Pointing it at `--quick` would drop the
corpus and with it the "cannot end a turn green while regressing the spine" property the
playbook advertises — the hook must get its speed from the cache, never from a smaller
gate set. It now checks *more* than the hand-rolled chain it replaced (six gates instead
of three, and it fires on any dirty path rather than only `src/`) at less wall time.

Deliberately outside the cache: lefthook's `pre-push`, which runs once per push and is the
last check before code leaves the machine. Not covered by the key: a `node_modules` change
with no lockfile change.

### The OOXML validator builds on demand and is then invoked as an assembly

> **Obsolete since 2026-08-15.** There is no local build to be stale:
> [ADR 0033](./0033-the-ooxml-oracle-is-a-shared-package.md) moved the oracle into the
> `ooxml-validate` package, which resolves a prebuilt binary. `scripts/ooxml-validator.ts`
> and its `resolveValidator()` are gone. Kept because the reasoning below — the cost of
> re-evaluating a project per call, and MSBuild reporting errors on the stream reserved
> for report JSON — is why the resolution problem was worth solving somewhere rather than
> living with.

`dotnet run --project` re-evaluates the project on every call — ~2–6 s for a tool whose
actual work is under a second. `scripts/ooxml-validator.ts` compares the DLL's mtime
against the newest source beside the project, builds only if stale, and otherwise hands
`dotnet` the assembly path. `resolveValidator()` is exported so the baseline harness
resolves the same assembly rather than keeping a second copy of the staleness rule.

The locked restore is folded in as `-p:RestoreLockedMode=true` on that build, which is
sound only because `packages.lock.json` is itself a staleness input. When it fails it
fails loudly: **MSBuild reports its errors on stdout**, which this process reserves for
report JSON, so build stdout is captured and replayed to stderr rather than discarded.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** one name for the gate set, so the hook, the hook's human, CI's intent and
  lefthook cannot drift apart. A clean-tree `--full` is ~14 s against ~27 s of serial
  work; a turn that changed nothing verifiable costs ~0.3 s.
- **No second definition left to drift:** `corpus.yml` is one `node scripts/verify.ts --full`
  step. Adding a gate is a one-line change in one file and CI picks it up. `build.yml` still
  enumerates its own steps, which is not the same duplication: it gates the *emitted* package
  (build → smoke → corpus-on-dist → size budget), a set `verify` does not contain.
- **`--jobs` is not tuned for the runner.** The default of 2 was measured on a 14-core box; a
  2-core GitHub runner is a different machine. Measure before assuming it is optimal there.
- **Revisit `composite` when** the dev/test loop stops being build-free — not before, and
  not without reproducing `TS6310` first.
