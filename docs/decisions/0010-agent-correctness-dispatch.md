# ADR 0010 — Make the correctness net easy for agents to dispatch

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-20) · Phase 4 · builds on [ADR 0002](./0002-ooxml-validation-oracle.md) (validation oracle) and [ADR 0007](./0007-spec-reference-vendored-schemas-and-learn-mcp.md) (spec reference + Learn MCP)

## Context

The project's machine-checkable safety net is deep — corpus (well-formedness, package
structure, regression), the Microsoft `OpenXmlValidator` oracle, vendored ECMA-376
XSDs, the microsoft-learn MCP, and the `docs/knowledge/specs/` notes. But the knowledge
of *which check to run when* was spread across CLAUDE.md, `docs/architecture.md`, four
ADRs, two skill files, and two READMEs. An agent mid-task had to reconstruct that
decision tree every time, and the highest-value tool — the schema oracle — had no skill
wrapping it and the most operational friction (.NET requirement, emit-a-file-first,
exit-code and baseline semantics). Two smaller leaks compounded it: the turn-boundary
Stop hook ran only typecheck + test:src, so a turn could end "green" while regressing
the corpus spine; and the microsoft-learn MCP was enabled only in the git-ignored
`settings.local.json`, so a fresh clone or agent didn't get it.

The gap was **dispatch and discoverability, not capability.** The fix is to surface the
existing net, not to add new validators.

## Decision

### A dispatch table agents actually reach for

`docs/agent-correctness-playbook.md` maps *what you are doing* → *the check that proves
it correct* → *the exact command*, cheapest-to-most-authoritative. CLAUDE.md §3 points
to it from the "Verify, don't assume" rule, and the closing See-also lists it beside
`architecture.md` and the ADRs.

### A skill for the oracle

`.claude/skills/validate-ooxml/` wraps `OpenXmlValidator` end to end: emit a repro
workbook from the `src` public API, run `pnpm run validate:ooxml`, read exit codes
(`0`/`1`/`2`), and keep `test/ooxml-validation/allowed-errors.json` honest. Skills
advertise themselves by description, so this is the primary streamlining win — it joins
`write-corpus-case` and `harvest-triage` as the third agent-facing workflow.

### Corpus joins the turn-boundary gate

`.claude/settings.json` Stop hook now runs typecheck + test:src + **corpus** when `src/`
is dirty (timeout 120 s → 180 s; measured ~23 s combined, 671 green / 0 regressions).
Corpus defaults to the `rewrite` adapter, so it genuinely exercises `src`. This closes
the "finished green but regressed the spine" gap. The .NET oracle is deliberately **not**
added to the hook — it needs .NET and is slower; CI's `ooxml-validation` workflow
enforces it on every PR regardless.

### The MCP enablement is now shared

`enabledMcpjsonServers: ["microsoft-learn"]` moves into the committed
`.claude/settings.json`, so every clone/agent gets the ADR-0007 spec-grounding MCP
(subject to the usual first-use approval prompt) instead of relying on a git-ignored
local file.

### Declined: a second, dep-light XSD validator

The obvious "make it reachable without .NET" move — wiring the vendored XSDs into an
`xmllint --schema` path — was **considered and rejected.** It directly contradicts the
standing decision in `schemas/README.md` and ADR-0002: the XSDs are read-only reference,
and a second validation path is a liability, not a convenience. XSD-only validation
can't run the semantic checks or validate the OPC parts, and the Transitional schemas
are subtly permissive — so it produces both false alarms and false confidence, and two
oracles that disagree is worse than one authoritative oracle plus an honest "not
available here." The no-.NET answer is therefore documented, not automated: rely on
corpus locally, read the XSDs/Learn MCP to reason, and let CI run the oracle. Reversing
this would mean overturning ADR-0002's single-oracle stance — do not wire a second
validator absent that explicit decision.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** the whole net is legible from one page; the schema oracle has a
  self-advertising skill; the spine can't silently regress across a turn; the spec MCP
  is on by default. No source code changed and no new runtime/dev dependency was added.
- **Neutral:** the Stop hook is ~15 s slower when `src/` is dirty — acceptable against
  its 180 s budget, and it only fires at turn boundaries, not per edit (the per-edit gate
  was already retired for false-alarm noise; corpus at turn boundary does not reintroduce
  that).
- **Revisit the XSD-validator decision only if** ADR-0002's single-oracle stance is
  itself revisited. Do not re-litigate absent that.
