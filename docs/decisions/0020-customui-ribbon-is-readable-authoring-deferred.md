# ADR 0020 — The customUI ribbon is readable through a typed view; authoring stays deferred

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-24) · customUI read slice

## Context

A macro-enabled workbook can customise the Office ribbon through one or two parts hung off the
**package root** `_rels/.rels`: `customUI/customUI.xml` (Office 2007 RibbonX, namespace
`.../office/2006/01/customui`) and `customUI/customUI14.xml` (Office 2010+, namespace
`.../office/2009/07/customui`, which also adds backstage / QAT / commands). Until now the library
handled both **only** opaquely — read captured each as a `PreservedRootReference` (bytes, content type,
relationship closure) and the writer re-declared it verbatim in the regenerated root rels, so a ribbon
survived a load/edit/save intact but **nothing could look inside it** through the public API.
`docs/knowledge/specs/xlsm-macro-preservation.md` named "parse the ribbon XML into a model, or leave it
opaque?" as a deferred question — round-trip fidelity was solved, but no consumer had forced a reader.

This mirrors exactly the position VBA was in before ADR 0016: preservation proved the bytes were there;
a typed read view was a bounded, self-contained slice that did not need a downstream caller to justify
existing, the same way `Workbook.vbaProject` did not. CLAUDE.md §3 ("bias to action… make the
reasonable call") authorises building it now.

The schema was pinned against the Microsoft-published references (MS-CUSTOMUI / MS-CUSTOMUI2 via the
Microsoft Learn docs), **not** guessed. Doing so surfaced a latent wrong fact in the existing fixture
(see Consequences).

## Decision

1. **The ribbon is exposed as a read-only, typed *view*, not a new source of truth.**
   `Workbook.customUI: readonly CustomUiDocument[]` parses each preserved-root `customUI` part
   **lazily** and memoises the result. Each `CustomUiDocument` carries its `dialect` (`'2007'` |
   `'2010'`) and the parsed `Ribbon` (`tabs → groups → controls`). Barrel-exported from `src/customui`
   alongside `parseCustomUi`, `CustomUiParseError`, the control/tab/group types, and the namespace /
   relationship-type constants.

2. **Preservation stays the sole emission authority.** There is **no** write path from `CustomUiDocument`
   back to bytes. Editing a workbook re-emits the original `customUI` XML unchanged, so the ribbon read
   view is strictly additive and cannot regress ribbon preservation — only one representation is ever
   serialised. Same invariant as the VBA read view (ADR 0016 §2).

3. **Dialect is keyed off the XML namespace, not the relationship type.** The `<customUI>` root
   namespace is the authoritative signal; the OPC relationship type is only used to *discover* which
   root references are ribbon parts (`isCustomUiRelType`, matching the `/ui/extensibility` suffix that
   both real rel types — `.../2006/relationships/ui/extensibility` for 2007 and, confusingly,
   `.../2007/relationships/ui/extensibility` for 2010 — share). This was a deliberate robustness call:
   the relationship type is frequently mis-copied (see Consequences), the namespace is not.

4. **Scope is the `<ribbon>` subtree only.** Tabs → groups → controls, plus each control's callback
   names (`onAction` is the whole reason a macro workbook ships a ribbon). A document's `<commands>`,
   `<backstage>`, `<contextMenus>`, and the ribbon's `qat` / `contextualTabs` are **not** parsed — they
   still round-trip byte-for-byte, they are simply not surfaced. `CustomUiDocument.ribbon` is `undefined`
   for a document that customises only those. The shape leaves room to add `backstage` / `qat` later
   without breaking callers.

5. **The control model is a discriminated union keyed by element name, over a shared base.**
   `RibbonControl.kind` is the closed set of RibbonX control element local-names, with `'unknown'` as
   the fallback so an unrecognised element is surfaced rather than dropped. The common attributes
   (`id` / `idQ` / `idMso` / `label` / `onAction`) are lifted onto the typed surface; container controls
   carry `children`; and the **full raw attribute map is preserved on every control**, so nothing is
   lost. *Exhaustive per-control attribute typing is deliberately deferred* — pinning the exact schema of
   ~15 control types for a no-consumer v1 is high surface / high risk, and the raw map already covers the
   many `get*` dynamic callbacks and layout hints the typed fields don't. When a consumer needs a
   specific control's exotic attributes typed, that's an additive refinement.

6. **The parser is treated as hostile-input-facing (CLAUDE.md §3).** It builds on the entity-safe
   `xmlEvents` scanner (no DTD/entity expansion), caps nesting depth so a deeply-nested part cannot
   overflow the recursive walk, and fails closed with `CustomUiParseError` on malformed XML, an
   unbalanced tree, a missing `<customUI>` root, or an unrecognised namespace — never a crash or a
   half-built tree. A ribbon-free workbook yields an empty array, never an error.

7. **Authoring stays out of scope.** Reading only. Mutating a ribbon back into valid RibbonX with correct
   `idQ` / callback wiring is a separate, larger effort with its own consumer-need question — the same
   posture ADR 0016 held for VBA authoring in its first slice.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** `workbook.customUI[*].ribbon?.tabs[*].groups[*].controls[*].onAction` reads the ribbon
  and its macro callbacks through a precisely-typed surface, with **zero new dependencies** (reuses the
  reader's `xmlEvents` SAX scanner and fflate's UTF-8 decode) and no risk to the preservation guarantee.
- **Corrected on the way in — a latent wrong fact fixed.** The `preserved-parts.test.ts` round-trip
  fixture declared the `customUI14` relationship as `Type=".../office/2009/07/customui"` — the schema
  *namespace* copy-pasted where the relationship *type* belongs. The round-trip test passed anyway
  because preservation is verbatim (garbage-in / garbage-out, faithfully), so the error was invisible
  until a reader depended on the type. Corrected to the real `.../office/2007/relationships/ui/extensibility`
  so the fixture represents a genuine Office file, and the reader keys dialect off the namespace to be
  robust to exactly this class of mistake in the wild.
- **Negative / deferred:** callers can *read* the ribbon tree but not *create or edit* it, and
  backstage / QAT / contextualTabs / commands remain opaque (they still round-trip). Forward map, each
  gated on a forcing consumer: parse the customUI14 backstage / QAT surface; type a specific control's
  full attribute set; and — the large one — ribbon authoring (model → valid RibbonX bytes).
- **Revisit when:** a concrete consumer needs backstage data, a fully-typed control, or ribbon authoring.
  No new ADR unless the shape of the decision changes.
