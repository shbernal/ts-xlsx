# Excel-oracle harness — geometry readback probe.
#
# Sibling of observe.ps1. Where that one asks "what formula/value does Excel see in these cells?",
# this one asks "what does Excel think the GEOMETRY of this sheet is?": per-row RowHeight, per-column
# ColumnWidth, and the sheet's StandardHeight/StandardWidth — then optionally re-saves a copy so the
# caller can read back the ht/width Excel itself considers canonical.
#
# That readback is how a clamp is distinguished from a passthrough. A package can carry an ht/width
# above what Excel's own object model accepts (`ht="5000"`); only reading the value back and diffing
# Excel's re-save shows whether it was clamped (rows: saturate at 409.6), quantized (widths: to
# 1/256 char), or honoured verbatim. See docs/knowledge/specs/grid-geometry-limits-are-excels-not-the-schemas.md.
#
# It takes an EXISTING workbook path rather than a probe spec: the fixtures worth asking this about
# are ones a writer already produced. Emit them however you like, then point this at the file.
#
# Every guardrail of observe.ps1 applies verbatim and for the same reason — a stray modal here
# deadlocks the agent forever: DisplayAlerts=$false + AutomationSecurity=ForceDisable +
# AskToUpdateLinks=$false, the COM work inside a background job under a wall-clock watchdog, an
# orphan sweep scoped to EXCEL.EXE PIDs THIS run spawned, and a finally that always Quit()s.
#
# Automation-open is not interactive-open. Those same suppressed modals mean this probe can detect
# that a repair happened (Open threw / the name carries "[Repaired]") but never reports the
# interactive open verdict — for that, escalate to the excel-gui-automation skill. See ADR 0013.
