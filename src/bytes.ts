 * the caller knows it, as a reader draining a length-prefixed stream does, which skips a pass over
 * the chunks. A lone chunk is handed straight back rather than copied, which is the common case on
 * the inflate path, where a part that fits in one chunk would otherwise be duplicated in memory the
 * moment it is read.
 *
 * The returned buffer therefore aliases the caller's chunk when there is exactly one. Every caller
 * here is a reader assembling bytes it then only reads, so this is sound; a caller that means to
 * mutate the result must copy it.
