// is the cheapest way for that to break, and it would break quietly: a wrong `TYPE_*` in one file
// yields a container this library still reads and Excel rejects.
//
// Only what both directions are bound by lives here. The v3 sector layout the writer chooses to
// emit does not, because the reader deliberately takes every one of those off the header it was
// handed: a file may legally say otherwise, and a shared constant would invite a reader to trust
// the layout over the header field.
