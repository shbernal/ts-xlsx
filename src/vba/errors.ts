 * Thrown when a VBA project (`vbaProject.bin`) is present but cannot be parsed: a malformed

 * A workbook with no macros never produces this: {@link Workbook.vbaProject} is `undefined` instead.
 *
 * The parser treats the blob as hostile input (a spreadsheet library parses untrusted files), so every
 * malformed structure fails closed with this error rather than crashing, hanging, or over-allocating.

/**
 * Thrown when authoring a VBA project (synthesizing a `vbaProject.bin` from module source) is asked to
 * produce something that cannot be encoded to a well-formed container: a stream name longer than the
 * [MS-CFB] 31-character limit, a duplicate stream name, or a project so large it would exceed the
 * writer's single-header DIFAT bound. This is a caller-side contract violation, distinct from
 * {@link VbaParseError} (which reports a malformed blob *read* from an untrusted file).
 *
 * It shares `code: 'authoring'` with `AuthoringError` rather than being one, and it is the only
 * subsystem in the tree that got its own authoring class. The reason is symmetry with
 * {@link VbaParseError} and not the VBA subsystem's importance: a caller who catches the parse error
 * to skip a macro project it cannot read is the same caller who catches the author error to skip one
 * it cannot write, and the two halves of that pair have to be nameable the same way. A CSV or table
 * authoring failure has no read-side twin to pair with, which is why those stay `AuthoringError`.
