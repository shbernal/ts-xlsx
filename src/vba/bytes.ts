// Read-side byte primitives for the VBA subsystem: the counterpart to the write-side `vba-encoding.ts`
// (`u16`, `u32`, `utf16le`, `push`). Every structure under `src/vba/` is a little-endian binary record
// ([MS-CFB] sectors and directory entries, [MS-OVBA] `dir` TLVs and compressed chunks), so these four
// are what its parsers are built from.
//
// The bound is checked here, once, rather than at each caller. A plain `buf[at] | (buf[at + 1] << 8)`
// reads `undefined | (undefined << 8)` past the end, which is `0`, so a truncated `vbaProject.bin` out of
// an untrusted `.xlsm` would parse as a file full of zeros instead of failing. `DataView.getUint16` is
// the obvious fix but the wrong one here: it throws `RangeError`, which is outside this package's
// failure taxonomy, and it is slow. Measured at 20M reads, a `DataView` constructed per call runs ~90x
// slower than the raw index and one cached per buffer ~8x, while the explicit `undefined` check below
// is indistinguishable from the unchecked read: V8 already bounds-checks the load, so the branch is
// free. `ms-ovba.ts` calls `readU16` once per copy token, so that difference is not academic.

// Neither joining chunks nor decoding UTF-16LE is a VBA concern; this subsystem is simply one of
// several callers of each, and `src/bytes.ts` is where both live. Re-exported rather than imported
// through, so a parser here reaches for one module and gets the whole vocabulary.
