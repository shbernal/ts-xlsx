// MS-OVBA §2.4.1: compression and decompression of a "CompressedContainer".
//
// VBA module source and the project `dir` stream are stored in Office's own run-length compression,
// NOT deflate. A container is a 0x01 signature byte followed by one or more chunks; each chunk
// decompresses to at most 4096 bytes and is either a raw 4096-byte copy or a stream of literal/copy
// tokens. Reference: [MS-OVBA] 2.4.1.3.6 (decompressing a CompressedContainer), 2.4.1.3.19.3 (the
// CopyToken bit-packing), and 2.4.1.3.7 (compressing a chunk).
//
// The decompressor is a hostile-input parser: the container comes from an untrusted file, so every
// length and back-reference is bounds-checked and the total output is capped. A malformed container
// fails closed with a VbaParseError rather than over-allocating, looping, or reading out of bounds. The
// compressor is the authoring inverse: it is fed our own bytes, and its output re-expands to the input
// byte-for-byte (the round-trip is the correctness contract).

 * boxed slots cost several times their byte count in real memory before the conversion to bytes ever
 * happens. The cursor is what makes the representation work for a run-length decoder: a
 * back-reference reads a byte this same sink already wrote, and {@link at} stays valid across a grow
 * because the buffer is copied whole. {@link set} is what makes it work for the encoder, whose flag
 * byte is written before the eight tokens it describes are known.
 *
 * The optional ceiling is the decode path's bomb guard, enforced on every write rather than after
 * each token so a hostile container can never provoke an allocation past it: growth is capped at the
 * ceiling too. The encoder is fed our own bytes and passes none.
