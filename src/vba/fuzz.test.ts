// An adversarial pass over the CFB container reader and the MS-OVBA decompressor.
//
// The same contract `io/xlsb/fuzz.test.ts` holds the BIFF12 reader to, for the same reason: a mutated
// container has no correct reading, so what is under test is that whatever the bytes say, the parser
// either produces a project or fails closed with a typed error, in bounded time and bounded memory.
//
// The three shapes each hide a bug inside a crash:
//
//   - a `RangeError` or `TypeError` escaping means a count out of the header became an index, a length
//     or a recursion depth without being checked first;
//   - a run that does not finish means a count out of the header became a loop bound;
//   - a run that finishes but allocates without limit means a count out of the header became an
//     allocation size, and the only thing standing between it and an OOM was the size of the input.
//
// This file is a `vbaProject.bin` shaped like the real thing, written by the production writer and
// compressed by the production compressor, so a mutation lands inside a structure real enough to reach
// the FAT, DIFAT, directory tree and decompressor rather than being turned away at the signature.

// The wall-clock ceiling any single parse must stay under. Generous by two orders of magnitude against
// a healthy parse of this seed, so it fires only on a genuine unbounded loop and never on a slow
// machine or a cold JIT.
