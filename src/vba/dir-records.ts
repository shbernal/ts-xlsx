// The `dir` stream's record grammar: the ids [MS-OVBA] 2.3.4.2 names, and the one walk over them.
//
// The stream is a flat sequence of TLV records, `Id(u16) Size(u32) data[Size]`, which is simple
// enough that three call sites each wrote their own walk. They were right to agree on the shape and
// wrong to have three chances to disagree about the exception:
//
// **PROJECTVERSION carries VersionMajor (u32) + VersionMinor (u16) after its fixed `Size=4` field,
// but `Size` only accounts for the 4-byte major.** The extra 2-byte minor is uncounted, so a uniform
// walk misaligns by 2 bytes from that record onward unless it skips them explicitly.
//
// Misaligning is not a thrown error. It is a walk that reads a length out of the middle of somebody's
// payload and then either overruns, which is caught, or lands on a plausible-looking boundary, which
// is not. The second is how a structural edit corrupts a macro project without saying anything. One
// walk, stated once, is what stops the fourth copy from being written without the correction.
