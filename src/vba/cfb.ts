// `vbaProject.bin` is a CFB container (the same "structured storage" behind legacy .doc/.xls). We read
// streams by name and, for the edit-in-place path, reconstruct the whole storage/stream hierarchy so it
// can be re-emitted through the writer with one stream swapped, so this is a deliberate subset of
// [MS-CFB]: header → FAT → directory, plus the mini-FAT for sub-cutoff streams, and the red-black
// sibling tree each storage navigates.
//
// It parses an untrusted blob, so every sector index, chain, and stream size is bounds-checked against
// the file and every chain walk is cycle-guarded. A malformed container fails closed with a
// VbaParseError instead of reading out of bounds, looping forever, or over-allocating.
