// The workbook's style tables, lifted off `Workbook` into the slice they actually are.
//
// Six fields that are all one thing: a table read out of `styles.xml` and handed back to the writer
// mostly untouched. `<dxfs>`, the named cell styles, the custom `<indexedColors>` palette, the
// `<mruColors>` swatches and the `<tableStyles>` block are all preserved rather than interpreted,
// because each is the target of an index held somewhere else in the file. Dropping one does not lose
// a look, it leaves a `dxfId`, an `xfId`, an `indexed="…"` or a `tableStyleInfo/@name` pointing at
// nothing. Beside them sits the one authoring verb that writes into the same territory,
// `addCustomTableStyle`, so a caller's own definitions and a file's are read back through the same
// object rather than from two halves of `Workbook`.
//
// `style.ts` holds the style *model* and `io/xlsx/styles.ts` the writer's interning tables; what
// lives here is the per-workbook state between them, and the four shapes that state is made of.
//
// Those four sat in `style.ts` until they were noticed for what they are: a named cell style, a
// differential style and the `<tableStyles>` block are not cell style at all, they are entries in
// workbook style *tables*, and keeping them beside `Fill` meant every module wanting a colour also
// pulled in the table-styles preservation vocabulary. They compose `CellStyle`, which is why they
// looked at home there; composing a type is not being one.
//
// The edge to the rest of the model is one, and it is `indexedPalette`. Resolving an `indexed="…"`
// colour needs this palette, but that is a colour-resolution concern rather than a styles one, so
// `WorkbookTheme` reaches it as a narrow accessor and the state stays here with the `<indexedColors>`
// element the writer emits from it. That is the same boundary `workbook-theme.ts` describes from its
// side; the accessor now closes over this slice instead of over `Workbook` itself.
//
// The doc comments for the public surface stay on `Workbook`'s accessors, which is what the API
// reference is generated from and what a consumer reads. See `docs/architecture.md`.

 *

 * fill, and border: its own object model exposes `Font`, `Interior`, and `Borders` on a table style
 * element and nothing for a number format, so a `numFmt` set here is carried faithfully through a
