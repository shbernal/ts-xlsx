// Modern threaded comments in the model — the review-style conversations Excel has written since 2018:
// an anchored discussion of authored messages with timestamps, replies, a resolved state, and
// @mentions. Distinct from a legacy note (`cell.note`), which is a single anonymous annotation; Excel's
// own UI draws the same line, calling these "comments" and those "notes". A cell carries one or the
// other, never both.
//
// The wire form lives in two parts (see `io/xlsx/threaded-comments.ts`): the messages per sheet, and a
// workbook-level identity registry the messages point into. The model mirrors that split — a thread's
// authors and mentioned people are {@link Person} entries resolved through
// {@link Workbook.getPerson}, not names duplicated onto every message.
