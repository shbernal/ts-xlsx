// The workbook's theme, lifted off `Workbook` into the slice it actually is.
//
// `theme.ts` holds the theme *model*: the slot order, the defaults, the value vocabulary. What lives
// here is the per-workbook state around it: the preserved part, the schemes decoded out of it, and
// the overrides a caller authored. Folding this into `theme.ts` would mix a pure value module with
// mutable per-instance state, which is how `theme.ts` grows the same legibility problem `Workbook`
// had.
//
// Nothing here touches the part's *text*. The codec decodes the schemes as it reads the part and
// hands both over together, and composes the authored overrides back onto the part as it writes; the
// model holds values on either side of that. See `io/xlsx/theme-xml.ts`.
//
// The boundary that matters, and the reason this slice is not as clean as the VBA one: colour
// resolution needs the workbook's custom `<indexedColors>` palette as well as the theme scheme, and
// that palette is *also* the writer's source for the `<indexedColors>` element and is populated by
// the reader. So it stays on `Workbook` and reaches here as a narrow accessor. Moving it would drag
// the styles-table state along and turn a theme overlay into a colour-and-styles overlay, which is
// not a slice.
//
// The doc comments for the public surface stay on `Workbook`'s accessors, which is what the API
// reference is generated from and what a consumer reads.
