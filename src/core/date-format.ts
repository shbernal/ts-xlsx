// Apart from `./date.ts`, which owns the serial arithmetic and the *classifier* (`isDateFormat`),
// because this is the only half either entry can decline to carry: the renderer is four kilobytes of
// month names and grammar, and `date.ts` is in the closure of every entry point there is while
// nothing but the CSV writer renders a date today. Splitting it costs one import at the two call
// sites and keeps four entries from paying for a table they never read.
//
// It is still the same vocabulary, and that is the point of ADR 0041: `Cell.numFmt` holds a format
// code, `isDateFormat` next door classifies one, and this renders one. The CSV writer used to carry a
// moment.js token table instead, in which the month is `MM` and `mm` is minutes, so a caller who
// passed a format code from this library got silent garbage back.

// The month and weekday names an Excel format code's `mmm`/`mmmm`/`ddd`/`dddd` render.
//
// English, and stated rather than taken from `Intl`. A format code carries its own locale directive
// (`[$-409]`), which is a fact about the *file*, while `Intl` would render whatever locale the
// process happens to run under: the same workbook would produce different CSV on a developer's
// machine and on a build server. Honouring the directive is the eventual answer; guessing from the
// environment is not a step toward it.

 * speaking different languages has no defensible answer to "which one is this".

 * Codes are case-insensitive, as Excel's are. What is *not* covered, deliberately: the elapsed-time
 * forms (`[h]`, `[mm]`), which measure a duration rather than name a moment, and the locale directive
 * (`[$-409]`), which is dropped rather than honoured -- month and weekday names render in English.
 * Both are recorded in ADR 0041.
