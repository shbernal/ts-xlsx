// Inclusive grid rectangles and the geometry a worksheet uses to reason about merged regions and the
// `sqref` ranges that overlays (data validations, conditional formats) apply to: decoding an OOXML
// `sqref` into containment rectangles, re-anchoring one through a splice, and collapsing the values a
// new merge covers.
//
// These used to be private methods on `Worksheet`, which split merge geometry across two files: the
// rectangle type and the overlap test lived here, while the operations that consume them lived there.
// Reasoning about "what does a merge do to the grid" meant reading both. The storage arrives as a
// parameter, so these stay pure functions of the rects and rows handed in. Resolving a covered
// position to its region's master is the one that did not stay a scan; it lives on `MergeIndex`.
