// The field table behind `Worksheet.model`'s round-trip.
//
// Both directions used to be hand-written statement lists, one in the getter and one in the setter,
// each enumerating the same fields. Nothing but a comment asked the next editor to touch
// both, and a field exported but not imported loses data silently: the merge-loss failure the
// model contract exists to prevent. Here each field declares both directions in one place, and the
// registry is proved exhaustive over `keyof WorksheetModel` at compile time, so adding a field
// without wiring it is an error naming the field rather than a review catch.
