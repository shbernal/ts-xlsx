// The last of `Worksheet`'s overlays to be lifted out (see "the two model classes delegate their
// state" in docs/architecture.md). It passes that section's test easily: it reaches nothing outside
// itself. The two things a merge does to the *grid* -- collapsing the values it covers, and widening
// the used extent -- stay on `Worksheet`, which owns the grid, and are driven by the rectangle
// {@link add} hands back. Pulling them in here would have given the slice two edges to buy one line.
//
// Three representations rather than one, and each earns its place. The range *strings* are what the
// sheet declares and what round-trips, including the unbounded `A:A` form that names no rectangle.
// The rectangles are what geometry is done against. The index is what keeps overlap-checking and
// covered-address resolution off a linear scan; see `merge-index.ts` for why that mattered.
