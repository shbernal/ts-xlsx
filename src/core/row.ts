// A handle on one row of a worksheet: its formatting and its cells, reached by row number.
//
// A handle, not a record. `Worksheet` keeps the authoritative stores — the cell grid and the sparse
// map of per-row formatting — and a `Row` reads and writes straight through to them, so two handles
// on the same number always agree and neither can hold a stale copy. That is the whole reason this
// is not a snapshot: a row object that copied its cells out would be the shape of the merge-loss
// class of bug the model contract exists to prevent.
//
// Position is fixed at construction, exactly as `Cell` fixes `(row, col)`. `sheet.getRow(3)` means
// "row 3" and keeps meaning row 3 — a splice that moves content past it does not carry the handle
// along, any more than it re-points a `Cell`.
//
// Formatting is created on write, never on read. Asking for `sheet.getRow(500)` costs nothing and
// does not extend the used range; assigning `height` is what materialises the record.
