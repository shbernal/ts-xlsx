// OOXML froze its formula-function grammar around Excel 2007. Every function Microsoft has added
// since (the dynamic-array family, LAMBDA and its helpers, the newer text and logical functions)
// is persisted in the sheet XML under an `_xlfn.` name-mangling prefix, which a worksheet-only
// function extends to `_xlfn._xlws.`. The prefix is purely an
// on-disk convention: the model only ever holds the plain, readable name, the writer applies the
// prefix on the way out, and the reader strips it back on the way in. A writer that omits it emits
// a formula current Excel silently drops, because the function is unknown under its bare name. This
// module is the single place that knows the mangling, shared by the xlsx writer and reader like
// address.ts and date.ts own their domains.
//
// A built-in function passed as a value, the `SUM` in `BYROW(A1:A3,SUM)`, takes a third prefix,
// `_xleta.`, and that one depends on the workbook around the formula: a defined name spelled like the
// function captures the bare name, so where such a name is in scope the bare name means the name. Both
// directions are therefore told which names the workbook defines.
//
// Moving the references a formula makes, for a shared-formula clone or a splice, is
// `core/formula-references.ts`. Both passes skip the text a reference cannot sit in through
// `core/formula-scan.ts`; `mangleParams` runs its own forward walk, because LET/LAMBDA parameter scope
// opens and closes at paren boundaries, state `scanFormula`'s per-run transform cannot carry, but it
// still defers to `skipOpaque`.
