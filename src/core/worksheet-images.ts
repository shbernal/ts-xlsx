// The pictures on a worksheet, lifted off `Worksheet` into the slice they are.
//
// Two kinds, and they are not the same thing: an *anchored* image is pinned to a grid rectangle or
// a grid point and moves with the cells under it, while the *background* tiles behind the whole
// sheet and is anchored to nothing. Both are held here because both are one opaque workbook image
// id that this class never dereferences: what an id names lives on `Workbook`, and the media
// registry is what resolves it.
//
// That opacity is what makes this a slice. Its only edge outside itself is `resolveAnchorPoint`,
// which needs to know how wide a column is and how tall a row is to turn a grid point into the
// model's own EMU units; those two arrive as accessors, the way `WorkbookTheme` takes the indexed
// palette it does not own. See the delegation rule in `docs/architecture.md`: the public accessors
// stay on `Worksheet` with their doc comments and become one-line calls into this.
