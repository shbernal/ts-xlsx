// The codec's back channel into the model.
//
// A reader has to push state into a `Workbook` that no authoring path can produce: a `<dxfs>` table
// whose indices existing rules already point at, a theme part carried as opaque bytes, a protection
// credential in finished agile form with no recoverable password. The streaming writer likewise has
// to drop a row's cells the moment they are serialised. All of that used to be public methods on the
// model classes, so they shipped in the `.d.ts`, appeared in the generated API reference, and a
// caller who tried one put the workbook in a state nothing else could reach or repair. There was no
// authoring/codec boundary at all: the model class *was* the codec's mutation interface.
//
// These symbols are that boundary. The operations still live on the classes and still mutate exactly
// the state they always did (this moves no data) but reaching them requires a symbol that is not on
// the public barrel and, because `package.json` exposes only the root entry, is not importable from
// outside the package at all. Inside the tree, the import is the audit trail: `grep` for this module
// and you have the complete list of code that can restore preserved state.
//
// Prefer an ordinary public method whenever a caller could reasonably want the operation. This is for
// operations that are *only* meaningful to the library's own machinery: mid-deserialisation, or
// mid-serialisation, which is how the streaming writer came to use the same key for its own plumbing.

/**
 * Keys the operations the library's own machinery may perform on a published class and a caller may
 * not (see `WorkbookInternals` / `WorksheetInternals`, declared beside their classes).
 *
 * Not only the model: `WorksheetStreamWriter` hangs its construction and its row-flush plumbing off
 * the same key, on the static side and the instance side respectively, because that class has the
 * identical problem one layer up. Its constructor took the writer's style registry and its
 * `flushedSheet()` returned the writer's flushed-row record, so seven internal types were named by a
 * published signature and none of them was a type a consumer could write down.
