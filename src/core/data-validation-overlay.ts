   * (`<x14:dataValidation>`), the carrier Excel uses for a list source on another sheet and other
   * shapes the standard element cannot express. The reader sets it for a rule found in that form so a
   * round-trip writes it back there instead of silently corrupting the cross-sheet reference.
   *
   * @throws {AuthoringError} when `sqref` names no area at all. A rule attached to nothing covers no
   * cell and is written back as the same unreadable text, so it is a mistake worth surfacing at the
