// Excel date serials: the bridge between a JS `Date` and OOXML's numeric storage.
//
// A spreadsheet never stores a date as such: it stores a number (the "serial") and a
// number format that tells the viewer to render that number as a date. What a serial
// counts from is the workbook's own declaration, not a constant: in the 1900 system
// serial 1 is 1900-01-01, and in the 1904 system serial 0 is 1904-01-01. The catch in the
// first is a bug Excel has carried since 1985 and every consumer must reproduce for
// compatibility: the 1900 date system counts a phantom 1900-02-29 that never existed
// (serial 60), so serials at or below 59 sit one calendar day later than a naive
// "days since the epoch" offset would place them. Round-tripping a date means reproducing
// that quirk faithfully in both directions, or imported pre-March-1900 dates land a day
// early - and reading the workbook's declared system, or every date in a 1904 file lands
// four years and a day early instead.
//
// Dates here are treated as UTC wall-clock: a serial carries no timezone, so we convert
// against a UTC epoch in both directions. A `Date` written and read back through this
// module is exact; the caller owns any timezone interpretation before it reaches here.

const MS_PER_DAY = 86_400_000;

// Serial 0 in the 1900 date system is nominally 1899-12-30. The phantom leap day lives
// at serial 60, so the offset correction pivots there.
const EPOCH_1900_UTC = Date.UTC(1899, 11, 30);
const PHANTOM_SERIAL = 60;

// Serial 0 in the 1904 date system is 1904-01-01, and the system carries no phantom leap day: it
// was Excel for Macintosh's way of not inheriting the Lotus bug. A workbook declares which system
// it counts in, and the two are 1462 days apart, so reading a 1904 file as a 1900 one puts every
// date four years and a day early. Verified against Excel Desktop: 2023-03-15 is serial 45000 in a
// 1900 workbook and 43538 in a 1904 one.
