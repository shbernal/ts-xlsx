// Address decoding: the foundational spreadsheet primitive.
//
// Every higher layer (cells, ranges, defined names, formulas) is ultimately
// addressed by a `col`/`row` pair, so this module is the first thing the rewrite
// builds and the bedrock everything else stands on. It is pure, allocation-bounded,
// and has no I/O or platform dependency.
//
// The honesty rule that drives the shape here: an axis that a reference does not
// mention is `undefined`, never a sentinel. A whole-row reference (`$1`) has no
// column; a whole-column reference (`$A:$A`) has no row. Legacy code let those
// absent axes decay into `NaN`/`"undefined"` and leak into serialized addresses
// (`"$undefined$1"`, `"NaN:NaN"`), the exact defect the corpus locks against.
//
// The decoders come in two arities and two temperaments. `decodeAddress`/`decodeCellRef`/
// `decodeRange` face a caller and throw, because a reference a caller supplied is a mistake at the
// call. `tryDecodeCellRef`/`tryDecodeRange` face a file and return `undefined`, because a file this
// library did not write is allowed to be wrong and losing one attribute beats losing the sheet.
// Read-side code uses the second pair and nothing else; the rule and the reasoning are `xml-scan.ts`'s.

// "The same words" is the whole point and it had stopped being true. `Range` re-implemented the pair
