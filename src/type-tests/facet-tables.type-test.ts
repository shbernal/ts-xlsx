// Type-level tests over the internal facet tables: the declarations that exist so a reader and a
// writer cannot fall out of step over the same set of fields.
//
// Each table pairs with an `AssertNever<Exclude<keyof T, table keys>>` alias beside it, which fails
// to resolve the moment the type gains a field the table does not name. That alias is already a
// compile error where it is declared; asserting it here is what states, in one place, which tables
// carry the guarantee, so a table added without one is visible as an absence rather than assumed.
//
// Which is worth exactly as much as the list is complete, and the list had drifted to six of eleven:
// `EveryColumnPropertyIsMirrored` was asserted and its literal twin `EveryRowPropertyIsMirrored` was
// not, and all four `page-setup.ts` proofs were missing. Nothing was unproven, because the alias
// fires where it is declared. What was wrong was the register's own claim: read it and you concluded
// `RowProperties` and `PageSetup` carry no exhaustiveness proof. `scripts/check-facet-register.ts`
// now holds the two in step, so the next proof added is either listed here or a failed gate.
