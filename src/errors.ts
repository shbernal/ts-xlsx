// The failure taxonomy every layer throws through.
//
// Typed error classes grew up one per subsystem that happened to want one, sharing no ancestor, so a
// caller could not ask "did *this library* fail?" without naming all of them, while the model's own
// validation threw bare `Error`, distinguishable only by string-matching the message. For a library
// whose input is untrusted files, "was it my file or my call?" is a first-class question, and it had
// no answer.
//
// Two levels of branch, deliberately non-redundant:
//   - `code` says what *kind* of failure this is: the question a caller usually has.
//   - `name` (and `instanceof`) says exactly which one: the question a caller occasionally has.
// A code shared by several classes is the design, not an oversight: a `code` in 1:1 correspondence
// with the classes would carry nothing the class did not already carry.
//
// Scalar argument validation stays *outside* this taxonomy. See {@link AuthoringError} for where the
// line falls and why.
//
// This module sits below every layer that throws (`src/xml`, `src/core`, `src/io`, `src/vba`,
// `src/customui` all import it), so it imports nothing itself; `scripts/check-layering.ts` enforces
// that.

/**
 * What kind of failure an {@link XlsxError} reports. This is the branch most callers want, and it is
 * deliberately coarse: the four answers are the four different things a caller would *do* next.
 *
 * - `'unsupported-format'`: the input is not a container this library reads at all (a legacy `.xls`,
 *   a blob that is not a spreadsheet). Nothing is wrong with the file; it is the wrong file *for us*.
 * - `'malformed-input'`: a part we do read is corrupt or does not conform to its specification. The
 *   file is broken, or hostile.
 * - `'authoring'`: the caller described a document that cannot exist. The bug is in the calling code.
 * - `'internal'`: an invariant this library maintains did not hold. It should be unreachable; if it
 *   fires, the bug is ours.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "not implemented yet" code. Every candidate for one turned out to be an
 * unreachable exhaustiveness guard (so: `'internal'`), and the one genuine feature gap (a binary
 * `.xlsb` cannot be row-streamed) is already reported by {@link UnsupportedFormatError}'s `format`
 * branch. A code with no throw site would be a promise the library does not keep.
 *
 * **Which of these is worth reporting upstream.** `'internal'` always is, and says so at runtime.
 * `'unsupported-format'` and `'malformed-input'` are worth reporting when the file in hand opens
 * cleanly in Excel: that combination means we are the ones who cannot read it, which is a gap, not
 * a corrupt input. `'authoring'` is worth reporting only if the document it refused is one a real
 * workbook can express. See `skills/ts-xlsx-upstream` for how to file one.

 *
 * Abstract on purpose: a failure always has a kind, so there is never a reason to throw the base.
 * Every subclass fixes {@link code} to a literal, which makes the class hierarchy a discriminated
 * union, so narrowing on `error.code` narrows the type.
 *

 * containing a newline or a zero-width character as one that looks identical to a name that does not,
 * which for a library whose input is untrusted is the difference between a diagnostic and a decoy.
