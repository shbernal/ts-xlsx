// The buffered `.xlsx` reader: an OPC zip package in, a Workbook model out.
//
// It reconstructs the part of the model the writer emits today: sheet names and order,
// cells holding a number, string, boolean, or formula, per-column width/visibility,
// per-row height/visibility, merged ranges, page margins, and cell styles (pattern fills,
// number formats, fonts, borders, alignment, and protection, per cell or inherited from a
// formatted row/column). Shared-formula slaves and the richer value kinds land as the model
// grows; an unrecognised construct is skipped rather than guessed, so a foreign file reads
// without crashing even where a facet is not yet materialised.
//
// This module is the orchestrator, and now only that. It wires the parsed package parts together (the
// OPC/rel resolution in `../opc/read-opc.ts`, the style table in `./read-styles.ts`, each worksheet
// body in `./read-worksheet.ts`) and decides the order a workbook is assembled in, which is where the
// non-local constraints live.
//
// Two questions it used to answer itself moved out. *Which package part does a feature live in* is
// `./read-parts.ts`: sheet- and workbook-part discovery, and the closure capture that carries verbatim
// whatever the model does not interpret. *What does `xl/workbook.xml` say* is `./read-workbook-xml.ts`,
// beside `workbook-xml.ts` which writes exactly those elements, because this tree keeps both
// directions of one wire form together and the workbook part was the last place that was not true.
//
// Untrusted input: inflate is bounded by a running byte counter (`./inflate.ts`) that caps
// actual decompressed output rather than trusting the archive's forgeable size headers, and
// the parser (ADR 0004) never expands entities.
