// `r` is optional on `sml:CT_Row` (and on `sml:CT_Cell`), because SpreadsheetML lets a producer rely
// on document position instead: the nth `<row>` of `<sheetData>` is row n, and the nth `<c>` of a row
// is that row's nth column. Excel always writes the attribute, so a reader tested only against Excel
// output never meets the other spelling; several non-Excel writers emit it, and against them a reader
// that requires `r` loses the whole sheet.
//
// The inference is one line, which is exactly why it belongs in one place: the two worksheet readers
// each had a copy, and they had already drifted. One inferred positionally and the other dropped the
// row's formatting outright, so the same file read one way through `readXlsx` and another through the
// row streamer. `CellAccumulator` and `CellStyleResolver` exist to make that class of divergence
// structurally impossible, and this is the third decision that belongs beside them.
