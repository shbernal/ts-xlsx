// preference is to keep both directions of one wire form in one place, where the two can be read
// against each other: `color-xml.ts`, `theme-xml.ts`, `tables.ts`, `rels.ts` and `font-xml.ts` all do.
// This part's reader had been living inside the orchestrator that happened to call it first, and the
// worksheet's layout blocks were doing the same until `sheet-properties.ts` took its half back.

// Every reader here is a {@link SaxPass} rather than a function taking the part's text, because
// `read.ts` drives all of them from one parse. Scanning the workbook part once per reader is what the
// worksheet part was already fixed for, and this part had got none of the treatment: six scans, of
// which four matched no element each.
