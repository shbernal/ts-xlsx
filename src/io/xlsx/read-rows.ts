// Streaming row reader: yield a worksheet's rows one at a time, without ever building the whole
// {@link Workbook} model.
//
// `readXlsx` materialises every cell of every sheet as a live `Cell` object held in nested Maps,
// fine for editing, but for a large sheet read purely to extract its data it holds the entire grid
// in memory at once. This reader instead *pulls* the sheet's XML through `xmlEvents` and yields a
// plain {@link StreamedRow} at each `</row>`, retaining only the row currently in hand. Peak model
// memory is one row, not the sheet.
//
// Two entry points sit on the same scanner:
//   - {@link readSheetRows} streams a single selected sheet's rows (the terse data-extraction case).
//   - {@link readWorkbookStream} yields a {@link StreamedSheet} per worksheet in workbook order, so a
//     caller can walk every sheet, and each sheet's rows still stream one at a time.
//
// Scope of this slice: the package is still inflated whole (bounded by the running counter in
// `./inflate.ts`) and shared strings / styles are read as whole parts, both being legitimately
// document-sized and cheap. What this avoids is retaining N materialised cells. A later slice can
// make the inflate itself per-part lazy; the pull primitive this stands on (`xmlEvents`) is the
// same one that path will use.
