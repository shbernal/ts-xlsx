//
// A hyperlink is not stored inside the cell in OOXML: the `<c>` holds only the visible label (a
// normal string value), while a separate `<hyperlink>` child of `<worksheet>` ties an A1 reference
// to a destination. An EXTERNAL destination (a URL) is reached indirectly, through a sheet
// relationship carrying `TargetMode="External"` that the `<hyperlink>` names by `r:id`. An INTERNAL
// destination (a location inside the same workbook, which the author writes as a `#`-prefixed value)
// is held directly in a `location` attribute with NO relationship. Emitting an internal target as an
// external relationship makes a strict consumer resolve both the rel and the location and render the
// destination doubled.
