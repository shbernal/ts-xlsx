// The part names the `.xlsx` writer generates, and the two other forms each of them is written in.
//
// Every generated part is named three times over, in three modules that never see each other's
// output. `write.ts` emits it under its package-absolute path; `workbook-xml.ts` declares that path
// again, slash-prefixed, as a `<Override PartName>` in `[Content_Types].xml`; and `worksheet-xml.ts`
// or `write.ts` names it a third time as a relationship Target, spelled relative to whichever part
// carries the relationship. A package where those three disagree is not malformed - it is
// well-formed and wrong, which is the expensive kind: the schema validates, and Excel then reports a
// part it cannot find, or silently drops the feature the relationship was reaching.
//
// So the path is written once, here, and the other two forms are derived from it: the content-type
// name by the slash, the relationship Target by the same {@link relativePartPath} the preserved
// references already went through. Renumbering a part kind or moving a directory is then one edit.
//
// SpreadsheetML-specific, and therefore here rather than in `io/opc/part-paths.ts`: those are the
// rules of the container (an extension, a `_rels` location, the arithmetic between two paths), which
// hold for any OPC package. These are this format's conventions about where a spreadsheet keeps its
// worksheets. The reader consults none of them, because it follows relationships instead of
// predicting names, and that asymmetry is deliberate: a file Excel wrote may put its parts anywhere
// OPC allows, so a reader that guessed would be wrong on real files.
