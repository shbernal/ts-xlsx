// What the reader does when a file describes something the model refuses.
//
// The taxonomy says an `AuthoringError` "is always the calling code that is wrong, never the input
// file; a malformed file raises a 'malformed-input' error instead" (`src/errors.ts`). The read path
// broke that every time it handed a file-derived string to a model method that validates: a
// duplicate sheet name, a 40-character one, a table called `1 bad`, and `readXlsx` threw
// `AuthoringError`, `SyntaxError` or `RangeError` at a caller who had done nothing but open a file.
// The last two are the worse half, because they are *native*: `catch (e) { if (e instanceof
// XlsxError) … }`, the one-line answer the taxonomy promises, does not see them at all, so the
// caller cannot tell "your file is broken" from "my own code threw".
//
// Excel repairs every one of those inputs on load, and that is the standard this module holds the
// reader to. There are two ways to meet it and they are not interchangeable:
//
//   - {@link repairSheetName}, where the model's rule is a *naming* rule and there is an obviously
//     right answer. A tab has to be called something, and a sheet dropped for its name would take
//     its cells, its position in the order, and every `localSheetId` that indexes past it.
//   - {@link admitting}, where the refusal is about the construct itself and there is nothing to
//     repair. A table whose name is not an identifier, a defined name scoped to a sheet that is not
//     there: the honest reading is that the file does not really carry that feature, so the feature
//     is dropped and the rest of the workbook is read.
//
// `admitting` is deliberately the *only* place the read path swallows a model refusal, so the set of
// constructs a corrupt file may silently lose is a list of call sites rather than a habit. It
// catches exactly the three types a model method raises about its own input. Anything else goes
// straight through: an `XlsxError` from a layer below, an `InternalError` of ours.
