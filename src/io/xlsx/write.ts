// The buffered `.xlsx` writer: a Workbook model in, an OPC zip package out.
//
// It serialises the part of the model that exists today (worksheets; cells holding a
// number, string, boolean, or formula; column/row formatting; page margins and
// header/footer; merged ranges; and worksheet tables) into a valid package (content
// types, relationships, workbook, per-sheet XML, table parts, the default theme and
// stylesheet, and core/app properties). Styles, images, and the richer value kinds land
// as the model grows; until then the writer refuses a value it cannot represent
// faithfully rather than emitting a lossy or corrupt package.
//
// This module is the orchestrator: it plans the package graph (via `package-plan.ts`) and
// stitches the serialised parts (from `workbook-xml.ts` and `worksheet-xml.ts`) into the
// part map. The row/cell renderer and the sheet's public render types live in
// `worksheet-xml.ts` and are re-exported here so the streaming writer's import surface is
// unchanged.

 * Assemble a workbook into the map of OPC package parts (part name → bytes) that make up an `.xlsx`,

 * per-sheet XML, styles, theme, media, tables, and props) factored out of {@link writeXlsx} so the
 * streaming writer can drive the identical parts through a streamed zip container rather than
 * `zipSync`. Neither writer duplicates a byte of serialisation.
 *
 * Three steps, and their order is load-bearing. The package is planned in full before anything is
 * serialised, so a drawing's embed and a pivot's cache can target a part number that already exists.
 * The sheets are serialised before the parts are emitted, because interning a style is a side effect
 * of that pass and `xl/styles.xml` is one of the parts emitted in the third step.
 *
 * @throws {AuthoringError} if the workbook has no worksheets, or holds a value the writer cannot represent.

 *
 * **A collision is refused.** Twenty sites write into this map, and the paths they choose come from
 * several independent numberings: the generated parts number from 1 per kind, and a preserved part
 * carries a path renumbered past them, or its own if the writer generates no part of that kind. When
 * one of those numberings was wrong, the later write simply won and the earlier part was gone from
 * the package with the content types still declaring both. Refusing here means the arithmetic is
 * checked at every write site at once rather than trusted at each.
 *
 * **The map has no prototype.** A preserved part can keep its original zip entry name, which comes
 * from an untrusted package, so a part path of `__proto__` is reachable. Assigned onto a plain object
 * it silently drops the part and re-points the map's prototype at its bytes. `io/opc/inflate.ts` and
 * `io/xlsx/edit-vba.ts` both defend against exactly this on the read side, and say why; this was the
