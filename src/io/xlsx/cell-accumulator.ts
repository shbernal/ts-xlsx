// Cell-gathering state machine for the worksheet-body reader. It owns the still-textual pieces of the
// one `<c>` currently being read (its address/type/style, formula, cached value, inline text, and
// rich-text runs) plus the shared-formula master map that spans the whole sheet. Each `<c>` resets
// the per-cell state on {@link beginCell} and commits it on {@link finalize}, so this class is the
// single owner of "what has this cell gathered so far": to a cell what {@link RunAccumulator} is to a
// rich string. Value *decoding* stays in `cell-value.ts`; this class only gathers the raw pieces.
//
// It also drives itself. {@link openElement}/{@link appendChunk}/{@link closeElement} are the
// `<c>`/`<is>`/`<f>`/`<v>`/`<t>` element machine both worksheet readers used to spell out
// identically, each with its own copy of the three flags it runs on (inside-an-inline-string,
// capturing, captured text). Two readers keeping one machine in step by convention is not a
// mechanism, and the flags are exactly the state that drifts: an element the two disagree about
// silently reads a different value on one path than the other. Each reader now contributes only
// what is genuinely its own -- what committing a cell means, and whether rich runs are read at all
// -- and falls through to this for the rest.
