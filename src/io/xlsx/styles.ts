// The write-side style table: the interned `<numFmts>`/`<fills>`/`<cellXfs>` backing styles.xml.
//
// The elements themselves are next door in `style-elements.ts`. The line is exactly the one this
// module is named for: nothing there touches a `StyleRegistry`, and this calls in there for every
// fragment it interns.
//
// OOXML styles are a *shared* table referenced by index: a cell (or a formatted row/column)
// names a `<cellXfs>` entry via its `s` attribute, and that entry names a fill by id and a
// number format by id. Identical styles must collapse to one entry, both to produce
// well-formed OOXML and to keep write cost bounded on large, lightly-formatted sheets (the
// historical performance cliff came from re-serialising a distinct style per cell). The
// registry interns each distinct fill, number format, and xf, handing back a stable index.
//
// Fills, number formats, fonts, borders, alignment, and protection are modelled today.
// Fills/fonts/borders are shared sub-tables the xf names by id, whereas alignment and protection
// are child elements *of* the xf, so each is interned into the xf signature directly rather than
// into its own id table, and an aligned/protected xf carries them as body children in that order.
// An unstyled cell/row/column resolves to xf 0.
