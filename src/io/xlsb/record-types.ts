// The BIFF12 record types this reader consumes, by their [MS-XLSB] "Record Enumeration" (section 2.3)
// numbers. Named constants rather than magic numbers at the switch sites: a record number carries no
// hint of what it is, so `BRT.CellRk` is the difference between a readable parser and a table of
// unexplained integers.
//
// Deliberately partial. [MS-XLSB] enumerates ~760 record types; listing the ones we do not decode
// would claim coverage we do not have. A record whose type is absent here is skipped by the parsers,
// which is the correct behaviour for a forward-compatible reader — the format grows, and an unknown
// record is always safely framed (its size is in the stream) even when its meaning is not known.
