// The buffered `.xlsb` reader: a binary OPC package in, a {@link Workbook} model out.
//
// An `.xlsb` is the *same* OPC/ZIP container and the *same* relationship graph as an `.xlsx`: the
// workbook part points at its sheets, its shared strings, and its style sheet through ordinary
// `.rels` XML. Only the office-document parts differ: `xl/workbook.bin`, `xl/worksheets/sheetN.bin`
// and friends are BIFF12 record streams instead of XML. So this module reuses the container layer
// wholesale (`../opc/`, the bounded inflater) and swaps only the part parsers, which is
// exactly the "two codecs over one model" shape the format note argues for.
//
// The model produced is the one `readXlsx` produces, not a parallel one: the same `Workbook`, the
// same `XfStyle` table, the same cells. That is what lets a caller convert between the two forms,
// and what the corpus asserts, by reading a workbook Excel saved in both forms and comparing.
//
// Not yet decoded (each its own slice of work, none silently wrong): rich-text runs, tables, pivots,
// and conditional formatting.
