// The BIFF12 half of the label check in `../xlsx/read-styles.test.ts`: a `BrtStyle`'s name and
// builtinId are invisible to a round trip, so nothing but a direct assertion on the parse can tell a
// reader that keeps them from one that drops them on the floor.
//
// It runs against the real binary package rather than a hand-framed record because the label's
// encoding (a flag word deciding whether the gallery index means anything, and a wide string after
// it) is exactly the part a hand-written fixture would get wrong in the same direction the reader
// does. The workbook model cannot be asked instead: a package whose only named style is Normal never
// reaches `restoreNamedStyles`, which is why this gap went unwatched.
