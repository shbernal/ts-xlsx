// correct reading. It is the *hostile-input* contract: whatever the bytes say, the reader either
// produces a model or fails closed with a typed error, in bounded time and bounded memory. Two
// failure shapes are called out specifically because each is a bug wearing a crash's clothes:
//
// - a `TypeError` or `RangeError` escaping means an index or a length reached the model unchecked
//   (`undefined` folded into arithmetic, an address outside the grid handed to the encoder);
// - a run that does not finish means a count taken from the file became a loop bound.
//
// The corpus fixture is the seed rather than random noise, so every mutation lands inside a structure
// real enough to reach deep into the parsers instead of being rejected at the first record.
