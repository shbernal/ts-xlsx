// About six hundred function names typed out of a normative table, with exactly one failure mode: a
// slip in the typing. It is invisible at runtime, because a name in the wrong slot still decodes, just
// to a different function, for every formula that cites that index. Nothing verified the
// transcription, so a slip made when it was written would still be there.
//
// These assert facts stated by [MS-XLS] 2.5.198.17 and by this module's own header, deliberately not
// re-derived from the runs the table is written as: a test that recomputed the table from the same
// literals would only prove the reduce works.
