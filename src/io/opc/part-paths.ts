// contains, so the XML and BIFF12 codecs, and the readers and writers within each, share it.

// Where the writer always puts the theme part. The workbook's theme relationship and the package's
// content-type override both name this path unconditionally, so a theme preserved from a source
// package that called its part something else is re-emitted here rather than at its original name.

 * The extension of a part path (`xl/media/image1.JPEG` → `jpeg`), or `''` when it carries none.
 *
 * Lower-cased here rather than by each caller. OPC extensions are case-insensitive, so an extension is
 * only ever used as a key or compared against a literal, and every caller but one folded the case
 * itself; the one that did not handed a raw `JPEG` to `addImage`, which folds later, so the same media
 * type could reach `[Content_Types].xml` as two `<Default Extension>` entries. Folding once at the
 * source is what makes the missed fold unrepresentable rather than merely unlikely.
