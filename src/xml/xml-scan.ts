// The XML scanner: source text in, events and attribute values out.
//
// OOXML uses a small, regular subset of XML, so the reader does not need, and must not pay for, a
// general-purpose DOM library (see ADR 0004). This scans the source in a single O(n) pass with no
// recursion, emitting open/text/close events; the OOXML reader consumes them and builds only the
// model, so peak memory tracks real content rather than document structure.
//
// Security posture: entities are *decoded, never expanded*. Only the five predefined entities and
// numeric character references are recognised; DTDs and `<!ENTITY>` definitions are skipped, so
// entity-expansion (billion-laughs) and external-entity (XXE) attacks are structurally impossible
// here, not merely mitigated.
//
// Everything here answers "what does this piece of markup say", plus the three OOXML booleans, which
// are readings of a value but are the ones every OOXML dialect asks for rather than only a
// spreadsheet. Two neighbours hold the rest. `xml-read.ts` holds the ways of *driving* a scan (the
// pull generators, the push adapter and its multi-pass driver, the verbatim subtree capture, the text
// gatherer), and nothing here holds a traversal. `xml-attrs.ts` holds the spreadsheet-flavoured
// readings of an attribute's value: the numbers with their floors, the numeric-literal coercion, the
// enumerated token, the `_xHHHH_` cell-text escape.
//
// Both seams are load-bearing rather than tidiness. `/customui` is a ribbon reader that wants the
// scan, an OOXML boolean, and nothing else; while its neighbours lived in one module every helper
// added to any of them was charged to that entry's bundle budget, which is how it drifted 3 KB over
// one before the first split and was left with 0.7 KB of headroom before the second.
