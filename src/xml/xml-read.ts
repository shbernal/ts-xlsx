// Ways of driving an XML scan: the pull generators a reader writes a `for..of` over, the push
// adapter and the multi-pass driver that lets several readers share one scan of a part, the
// verbatim subtree capture, and the gatherer that reassembles one element's text.
//
// The scan itself, and the readings of a single attribute's text, are `xml-scan.ts`. The split is
// by what a helper does with the source rather than by who calls it: everything here walks a
// document, nothing there does. `elementSubtrees` is the reason the scanner exports its markup and
// tag primitives rather than keeping them private - it is a second scanner over the same text, and
// the two must agree to the character about where an element ends.

 * none of them honoured the one thing {@link SaxHandlers.onOpen} warns about. A self-closing `<x/>`
 * fires no matching close, so `<t/>`, `<text/>`, `<xm:f/>` and `<totalsRowFormula/>`, all legal and
 * all written by real files, latched a capture that nothing would ever close. What kept that from
 * corrupting anything was the order the next open happened to reset things in, which is an accident
 * rather than a property anyone chose, on a path that reads untrusted input. Taking `selfClosing`
 * here makes it structural, once.
 *
 * The other thing the open-coded versions disagreed on is what an unrelated element opening
 * mid-capture should do. Ending the capture is never what a caller wants: the text belongs to the
 * element that opened it, and a nested or sibling element is not that element. So an open that is
 * not for a captured name leaves an capture in progress alone, and {@link close} answers only for
 * the element that started it.
 *
 * Decoding stays outside. A `<t>` needs `decodeSpreadsheetText` over the whole element and never
 * over a chunk, an `<xm:f>` needs nothing, and a coordinate needs a number: the caller knows which.
