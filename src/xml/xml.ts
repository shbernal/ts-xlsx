// Minimal XML serialisation helpers for the write path.
//
// Writing OOXML needs only correct escaping and well-formed structure; parsing (the
// reader's concern) is a separate, later decision, so no XML library is on the write
// path. Escaping is the one hard, security-relevant requirement, since an unescaped `<`,
// `&`, or `"` produces a malformed package a consumer rejects, so it lives here,
// audited once, rather than sprinkled through the part emitters.
//
// A second class of character is harder than `&`: the ones XML 1.0 has no syntax for at
// all. `&#1;` is not an escape for U+0001, it is another way of spelling the same illegal
// document. So there are two behaviours here, and which one applies is decided by the
// destination rather than by the character.
//
// **Prose the user typed** is escaped `_xHHHH_`. That is SpreadsheetML's own convention, and
// where it applies Excel both writes it and decodes it on the way back in. Which elements are
// in that group is a measured fact, not a schema one, and each was settled over COM against
// Excel Desktop: a `<t>` inline string, the cached `<v>` of a `t="str"` formula cell, a
// threaded comment's `<text>`, and a `<headerFooter>` child's print header text, which all read
// back as the decoded character and are written back out re-escaped by Excel itself. So
// `textElement`, the `t="str"` result, the threaded-comment body and the header/footer children
// get `escapeSpreadsheetText`.
//
// **Everything else is refused.** The schema is no help in drawing that line: `ST_Xstring`
// types a sheet name and a defined name just as it types `<t>`, so following the type alone
// would have us escape a sheet name too, and a workbook whose tab reads `Sheet_x0001_A` is
// not a faithful rendering of the name the author asked for, it is a different name. Where
// there is no faithful representation the honest answer is `AuthoringError`, which is the
// stance `numberText` below already takes on a non-finite number for the same reason. That
// covers every structural string: sheet and defined names, formulas, table column names,
// document properties, and relationship targets.
//
// The two comment systems land on the same side of that line by two different routes, which
// is why the test is *does Excel decode it here* rather than *does this read as prose*. A
// legacy note's body is a `<t>` in a `CT_Rst`, the very type the convention is defined on. A
// threaded comment's `<text>` is a different element in the 2018 extension namespace with no
// documented escape at all; it took a measurement to put it here, and it decodes with the
// same closed grammar and the same single pass. A print header was refused on that reading
// until it too was measured: its `&`-prefixed section codes look like the only in-band syntax
// it has, but Excel decodes `_xHHHH_` in a header exactly as it does in a cell and writes a
// control character back out escaped, so the two syntaxes share one string without either
// knowing about the other.
//
// Refusing is a new throw on a path that used to "succeed" by producing a file Excel reports
// as damaged, so the failure moved earlier and got louder, which is the whole trade.
